#Builders Part I - Basic Controls

One of the most exciting features of TornadoFX are the Type-Safe Builders. Configuring and laying out controls for complex UI's can be verbose and difficult, and the code can quickly become messy to maintain. Fortunately, you can use a [powerful closure pattern](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html) pioneered by Groovy to create structured UI layouts with pure and simple Kotlin code.

While we will learn how to apply FXML later, you may find builders to be an expressive, robust way to create complex UI's in a fraction of the time. There are no configuration files or compiler magic tricks, and builders are done with pure Kotlin code. The next few chapters will divide the builders into separate categories of controls. Along the way, you will gradually build more complex UI's by integrating these builders together. 

But first, let's cover how builders actually work. 

##How Builders Work
Kotlin's standard library comes with a handful of helpful "block" functions to target items of any type `T`. You have already seen the [with() function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/with.html), which allows you to write code against an item as if you were right inside of its class. 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `with()` function accepts the `root` as an argument. The  following closure argument manipulates `root` directly by referring to it as `this`, which is safely interpreted as a `VBox`. A `Button` was added to the `VBox` by calling it's `plusAssign()` extended operator. 

Alternatively, every type in Kotlin has an [apply() function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/apply.html). This is almost the same functionality as `with()` but it is actually an extended higher-order function.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        root.apply { 
            this += Button("Press Me")
        }
    }
}
```

Both `with()` and `apply()` accomplish a similar task. They safely interpret the type they are targeting and allow manipulations to be done to it. However, `with()` returns `Unit` so it does not return any meaningful value, whereas `apply()` does in fact return the item it was targeting. Therefore, if you call `apply()` on a `Button` to manipulate  say, its font color and action, it is helpful the `Button` returns itself so as to not break the declaration flow. 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me").apply {
                textFill = Color.RED
                setOnAction { println("Button pressed!") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The basic concepts of how builders work are expressed above, and there are three tasks being done: 

1. A `Button` is created
2. The `Button` is modified
3. The `Button` is added to its "parent", which is a `VBox`

When declaring any `Node`, these three steps are so common that TornadoFX streamlines them for you using strategically placed extension functions.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            button("Press Me") {
                textFill = Color.RED
                setOnAction { println("Button pressed!") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

While this looks much cleaner, you might be wondering: "How did we just get rid of the `this +=` and `apply()` function call? And why are we using a function called `button()` instead of an actual `Button`?"  

We will not go too deep on how this is done, and you can always dig into the source code if you are curious. But essentially, the `VBox` as well as any `Pane` has an extension function called `button()`. It accepts a text argument and an optional closure targeting a `Button` it will instantiate. When this function is called, it will create a `Button` with the specified text, apply the closure to it, add it to the `Pane` it was  called on, and then return it. 

Taking this efficiency further, you can override the `root` in a `View`, but assign it a builder function and avoid needing any `init` and `with()` blocks. 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {
        button("Press Me") {
            textFill = Color.RED
            setOnAction { println("Button pressed!") }
        }
    }
}
```

The builder pattern becomes especially powerful when you start nesting controls into other controls. Using these builder extension functions, you can easily populate and nest multiple `HBox` instances into a `VBox`, and create UI code that is clearly structured (Figure 4.1).

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox { 
	     hbox {
             label("First Name")
             textfield()
         }
         hbox {
             label("Last Name")
             textfield()
         }
         button("LOGIN") {
             useMaxWidth = true
         }
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.1**

If you need to save references to controls such as the TextFields, you can save them to variables or properties since the functions return the produced Nodes. It is recommend you use the `singleAssign()` delegates to ensure the properties are only assigned once. 

>Also note we will learn about TornadoFX's proprietary `Form` later, which will make simple input UI's like this even simpler to code. 

```kotlin

class MyView : View() {

    var firstNameField: TextField by singleAssign()
    var lastNameField: TextField by singleAssign()

    override val root = vbox {
        hbox {
            label("First Name")
            firstNameField = textfield()
        }
        hbox {
            label("Last Name")
            lastNameField = textfield()
        }
        button("LOGIN") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            setOnAction {
                println("Logging in as ${firstNameField.text} ${lastNameField.text}")
            }
        }
    }

}
```

Note that non-builder extension functions and properties have been added to Nodes as well. The `useMaxWidth` is an extended property for `Node`, and it sets the `Node` to occupy the maximum width allowed. We will see more of these helpful extensions throughout the next few chapters, and you can view a comprehensive list of these extensions in Appendix X. 

In the coming chapters, we will cover each corresponding builder for each JavaFX control. With the concepts understood above, you can read about these next chapters start to finish or as a reference. 

##Builders for Basic Controls

The rest of this chapter will cover builders for basic JavaFX controls like `Button`, `Label`, and `TextField`. The next chapter will cover builders for data-driven controls like `ListView`, `TableView`, and `TreeTableView`. 

###Button

For any `Pane`, you can call its `button()` extension function to add a `Button` to it. You can optionally pass a `text` argument and a `Button.() -> Unit` lambda to modify its properties.

Within a `Pane`, this will add a `Button` with red text and will print "Button pressed!" every time it is clicked (Figure 4.2)

```kotlin
button("Press Me") {
    textFill = Color.RED
    setOnAction {
        println("Button pressed!")
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.2**

![](http://i.imgur.com/jdOLEIU.png)

###Label
For any `Pane`, you can call its `label()` extension function to add a `Label` to it. You can optionally pass a `String` or `Property<String>` that will provide its text, and a `Label.() -> Unit` lambda to modify its properties (Figure 4.3).

```kotlin
label("Lorem ipsum") {
    textFill = Color.BLUE
}
```
**Figure 4.3**

![](http://i.imgur.com/knGKEGy.png)

###TextField
For any `Pane` you can add a `TextField` by calling its `textfield()` extension function (Figure 4.4).

```kotlin
textfield() 
```

**Figure 4.4**

![](http://i.imgur.com/yFm42kL.png)

You can optionally provide initial text as well as a closure to manipulate the `TextField`.  For example, we can add a listener to its `textProperty()` and print its value every time it changes (Figure 4.5).

```kotlin
textfield("Input something") {
    textProperty().addListener { obs, old, new ->
        println("You typed: " + new)
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.6**

![](http://i.imgur.com/0wl9dGk.png)

###PasswordField
If you need a `TextField` to take sensitive information, you might want to consider a `PasswordField` instead. It will show anonymous characters to protect from prying eyes. You can also provide an initial password as an argument and a block to manipulate it (Figure 4.7).

```kotlin
passwordfield("my_password") {
    requestFocus()
}
```

**Figure 4.7** 

![](http://i.imgur.com/76Pc5ZJ.png)

###CheckBox
You can create a `CheckBox` to quickly create a true/false state control and  optionally manipulate it with a block (Figure 4.8).

```kotlin
checkbox("Admin Mode") {
    setOnAction { println(isSelected) }
}
```
**Figure 4.9**

![](http://i.imgur.com/w3ASTm8.png)


You can also provide a `Property<Boolean>` that will bind to its state. 

```kotlin
val booleanProperty = SimpleBooleanProperty()

checkbox("Admin Mode", booleanProperty) {
    setOnAction { println(isSelected) }
}
```

###ComboBox

A `ComboBox` is a drop down control that allows a fixed set of values to be selected from (Figure 4.10).

```kotlin
val texasCities = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Austin",
	"Dallas","Midland", "San Antonio","Fort Worth")

combobox<String> {
    items = texasCities
}
```

**Figure 4.10**

![](http://i.imgur.com/kDay7az.png)

You do not need to specify the generic type if you declare the `values` as an argument. 

```kotlin
val texasCities = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Austin",
        "Dallas","Midland","San Antonio","Fort Worth")

combobox(values= texasCities)
```

You can also specify a `Property<T>` to be bound to the selected value. 


```kotlin
val texasCities = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Austin",
        "Dallas","Midland","San Antonio","Fort Worth")

val selectedCity = SimpleStringProperty()

combobox(selectedCity, texasCities)
```

###ToggleButton

A `ToggleButton` is a button that expresses a true/false state depending if it is pressed or not (Figure 4.11).

```kotlin
togglebutton("OFF") {
    setOnAction { 
        text = if (isSelected) "ON" else "OFF" 
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.11**

![](http://i.imgur.com/4wdBEzg.png) ![](http://i.imgur.com/uMrmhnT.png)

You can optionally pass a `ToggleGroup` to the `togglebutton()` function. This will ensure all `ToggleButton`s in that `ToggleGroup` can only have one selection at a time (Figure 4.12).

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = HBox()
    private val toggleGroup = ToggleGroup()

    init {
        with(root) {
            togglebutton("YES", toggleGroup)
            togglebutton("NO", toggleGroup)
            togglebutton("MAYBE", toggleGroup)
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.12**

![](http://i.imgur.com/Z6DsB5b.png)

###RadioButton

A `RadioButton` is the same functionality as a `ToggleButton` but with a different visual style. When it is selected, it "fills" in a circular control (Figure 4.13). 

```kotlin
radiobutton("Power User Mode") {
    setOnAction {
       println("Power User Mode: $isSelected") 
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.13**

![](http://i.imgur.com/ZMF8mfQ.png)

Also like the `ToggleButton`, you can set a `RadioButton` to be included in a `ToggleGroup` so that only one item in that group can be selected at a time (Figure 4.14). 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()
    private val toggleGroup = ToggleGroup()

    init {
        with(root) {
            radiobutton("Employee", toggleGroup)
            radiobutton("Contractor", toggleGroup)
            radiobutton("Intern", toggleGroup)
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.14**

![](http://i.imgur.com/cTPyeXg.png)

###DatePicker

The `DatePicker` is a simple control to call. It allows you to choose a date from a popout calendar control. You can optionally provide a block to manipulate it (Figure 4.15).


```kotlin
datepicker {
    value = LocalDate.now()
}
```

**Figure 4.15**

![](http://i.imgur.com/TXGuHPF.png)


You can also provide a `Property<LocalDate>` as an argument to bind to its value. 

```kotlin
val dateProperty = SimpleObjectProperty<LocalDate>()

datepicker(dateProperty) {
    value = LocalDate.now()
}
```

###TextArea

The `TextArea` allows you input multiline freeform text. You can optionally provide the inital text `value` as well as a block to manipulate it on declaration (Figure 4.16).

```kotlin
textarea("Type memo here") {
    selectAll()
}
```

**Figure 4.16**

![](http://i.imgur.com/qTNbBrk.png)

###ProgressBar

A `ProgressBar` visualizes progress towards completion of a process. You can optionally provide an "initial value" `Double` less than or equal to 1.0 indicating percentage of completion (Figure 4.17).

```kotlin
progressbar(0.5)
```

**Figure 4.17**

![](http://i.imgur.com/ngBKWs9.png)


Here is a more dynamic example simulating progress over a short period of time. 

```kotlin
progressbar() {
    thread {
        for (i in 1..100) {
            Platform.runLater { progress = i.toDouble() / 100.0 }
            Thread.sleep(100)
        }
    }
}
```

You can also pass a `Property<Double>` that will bind the `progress` to its value as well as a block to manipulate the `ProgressBar`.

```kotlin
progressbar(completion) {
    progressProperty().addListener {
        obsVal, old, new ->  print("VALUE: $new")
    }
}
```
###ProgressIndicator

A `ProgressIndicator` is functionally identical to a `ProgressBar` but uses a filling circle instead of a bar (Figure 4.18).

```kotlin
progressindicator {
    thread {
        for (i in 1..100) {
            Platform.runLater { progress = i.toDouble() / 100.0 }
            Thread.sleep(100)
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.18**

![](http://i.imgur.com/eAGX9KP.png)  ![](http://i.imgur.com/6lt70hL.png)


Just like the `ProgressBar` you can provide a `Property<Double>` and/or a block as optional arguments (Figure 4.19).

```kotlin
val completion = SimpleObjectProperty(0.0)
progressindicator(completion)
```

###ImageView

You can embed an image using `imageview()`. 

```kotlin
imageview("tornado.jpg")
```

**Figure 4.19**

![](http://i.imgur.com/Jfp9gCo.png)


Like most other controls, you can use a block to modify its attributes (Figure 4.20). 

```kotlin
imageview("tornado.jpg") {
    scaleX = .50
    scaleY = .50
}

```

**Figure 4.20**

![](http://i.imgur.com/GWlqlVn.png)

###ScrollPane

You can embed a control inside a `ScrollPane` to make it scrollable. When the available area becomes smaller than the control, scrollbars will appear to navigate the control's area. 

For instance, you can wrap an `ImageView` inside a `ScrollPane` (Figure 4.21).

```kotlin
scrollpane {
    imageview("tornado.jpg")
}
```

**Figure 4.21**

![](http://i.imgur.com/81roP20.png)


Keep in mind that many controls like `TableView` and `TreeTableView` already have scroll bars on them, so wrapping them in a `ScrollPane` is not necessary (Figure 4.22).

###Hyperlink

You can create a `Hyperlink` control to mimic the behavior of a typical hyperlink to a file, a website, or simply perform an action.

```kotlin
hyperlink("Open File") {
    setOnAction { println("Opening file...")}
}
```

**Figure 4.22**

![](http://i.imgur.com/ZWPxf0N.png)

###Text

You can add a simple piece of `Text` with formatted properties. This control is simpler and rawer than a `Label`, and paragraphs can be separated using `\n` characters (Figure 4.23). 

```kotlin
text("Veni\nVidi\nVici") {
    fill = Color.PURPLE
    font = Font(20.0)
}
```

**Figure 4.23**

![](http://i.imgur.com/hlABXZe.png)


###TextFlow
If you need to concatenate multiple pieces of text with different formats, the `TextFlow` control can be helpful (Figure 4.24).

```kotlin
textflow {
    text("Tornado") {
        fill = Color.PURPLE
        font = Font(20.0)
    }
    text("FX") {
        fill = Color.ORANGE
        font = Font(28.0)
    }
}
```	

**Figure 4.24**

![](http://i.imgur.com/8sgruNJ.png)

You can add any `Node` to the `textflow`, including images, using the standard builder functions. 


###Tooltips

Inside any `Node` you can specify a `Tooltip` via the `tooltip()` function (Figure 4.25).

```kotlin
button("Commit") {
    tooltip("Writes input to the database")
}
```

**Figure 4.25**

![](http://i.imgur.com/TfFKrGH.png)

Like most other builders, you can provide a closure to customize the `Tooltip` itself. 

```kotlin
button("Commit") {
    tooltip("Writes input to the database") {
        font = Font.font("Verdana")
    }
}
```

**SUMMARY**

In this chapter we learned about TornadoFX builders and how they work simply by using Kotlin extension functions. We also covered builders for basic controls like `Button`, `TextField` and `ImageView`. In the coming chapters we will learn about builders for tables, layouts, menus, charts, and other controls. As you will see, combining all these builders together creates a powerful way to express complex UI's with very structured and minimal code. 

These are not the only control builders in the TornadoFX API, and this guide does its best to keep up. Always check the [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) GitHub to see the latest builders and functionalities available, and file an issue if you see any missing.
