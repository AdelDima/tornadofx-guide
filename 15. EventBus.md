# 15. EventBus

An EventBus is a versatile tool with a multitude of use cases. Depending on your coding style and 
preferences, you might want to reduce coupling between controllers and views by passing messages
instead of having hard references to each other. The TornadoFX event bus can even make sure
that the messages are received on the appropriate thread without having to do that house keeping manually.

People use event buses for many different use cases, and TornadoFX doesn't dictate when or how you should
use it but we want to show you some of the advantages it can provide to you.

## Structure of the EventBus

As with any typical event bus implementation you can fire events as well as subscribe and unsubscribe
to events on the bus. You create an event by extending the `FXEvent` class. In some cases an event
can be just a signal to some other component that you want something to happen. In other cases the
event can contain data which will be broadcast to the subscribers of this event. Let's look at a couple of
event definitions and how to use them.

Let's picture a UI where the user can click a button to refresh a list of customers. The view
knows nothing of where the data is coming from or how it is produced, but it knows how to subscribe
to data events and how to extract the data once it arrives. Let's create two event classes for this use case.

First we define an event signal we can use to notify any listeners that we want some customer data:

```kotlin
object CustomerListRequest : FXEvent(runOnFxApplicationThread = false)
```

This event object is a singleton object, because it will never need to contain data, it will simply be
broadcast to say that we want the customer list. The `runOnFxApplicationThread` property is set to false, to signal
that the receiver of this event should operate off of the JavaFX Application Thread. That means it will be
given a background thread by default, so that it can do heavy work without having to think about spawing a background 
thread manually to avoid blocking the UI.
 
A button in the UI can fire this event by using the `fire` function:
 
```kotlin
button("Load customers") {
   setOnAction {
       fire(CustomerListRequest)
   }
}
```

The CustomerController might listen for this event, and load the customer list on demand before it fires an event 
with the actual customer data. First we need to define an event that can contain the customer list:

```kotlin
class CustomerListEvent(val customers: List<Customer>) : FXEvent()
```

This event is not an object, as it will contain actual data. Also, it did not touch the default 
`runOnFxApplicationThread` property, so this event will be emitted on the JavaFX Application Thread.

A controller can now subscribe to our request for data and emit that data once it has it:

```class CustomerController : Controller() {
    init {
        subscribe<CustomerListRequest> {
            val customers = loadCustomers() 
            fire(CustomerListEvent(customers)) 
        }
    }
    
    fun loadCustomers(): List<Customer> = db.selectAllCustomers()
}```

Back in our UI, we can listen to this event inside the customer table definition:

```kotlin
tableview<Customer> {
   column("Name", Customer::nameProperty)
   column("Age", Customer::ageProperty)
   
   subscribe<CustomerListEvent> { event ->
       items.setAll(event.customers)
   }
}
```

We tell the event bus that we are interested in `CustomerListEvent`s, and once we have such an event we
extract the customers from the event and set them into the `items` property of the `TableView`.

## Query parameters in events

Above you saw a signal used to ask for data, and an event returned with that data. The signal could just as well
contain query parameters, for example it could be used to ask for a specific customer. Imagine these events:

```kotlin
class CustomerQuery(val id: Int) : FXEvent(false)
class CustomerEvent(val customer: Customer) : FXEvent()
```

Using the same procedure as above, we can now signal our need for a specific customer, but we now need to be
more careful with the data we get back. If our UI allows for multiple customers to be edited at once, we need to
make sure that we only apply data for the customer we asked for. This is quite easily accounted for though:

```kotlin
class CustomerEditor(val customerId: Int) : View() {
   val model : CustomerModel
   
   override val root = form {
       fieldset("Customer data") {
          field("Name") {
              textfield(model.name)
          }
          // More fields and buttons here
       }
   }
   
   init {
       subscribe<CustomerEvent> {
           if (it.customer.id == customerId)
               model.item = it.customer
       }
       fire(CustomerQuery(customerId))    
   }
}
```

The UI is created before the interesting bit happens in the `init` function. First we subscribe to `CustomerEvent`s,
but we make sure to only act once we retrieve the customer we were asking for. If the customer id matches,
 we assign the customer to the item property of our `ItemViewModel`, and the UI is updated.
 
A nice side effect of this is that our customer object will be updated whenever the system emits new data
for this customer, no matter who asked for them.

## Events and threading

When you create a subclass of `FXEvent` you dictate the value of the `runOnFxApplicationThread` property. It is true
by default, meaning that the subscriber will receive the event on the JavaFX Application Thread. This is useful for events
coming from and going to other UI components, as well as backend services sending data to the UI. If you want to
signal something to a backend service, one which is likely to perform heavy work, you should set `runOnFxApplicationThread`
to false, making sure the subscriber will operate off of the UI thread. The subscriber now no longer needs to
make sure that it is off of the UI thread, so you remove a lot of thread related house keeping calls. Used correctly
this is very convenient and powerful. Used wrong, you will have a non responsive UI. Make sure you understand
this completely before playing with events, or always wrap long running tasks in `runAsync {}`.

## Scopes

The event bus works across all scopes. If you want to limit signals to a certain scope, a good way of doing this
is to create a property for the scope inside the event subclass. Then you can discriminate on scope much the same
way we discriminated on the `customerId` property earlier. Let's revisit our first example and add scope support to it.


```kotlin
class CustomerListRequest(scope: Scope) : FXEvent(runOnFxApplicationThread = false)
```

The CustomerListRequest is not an object anymore since it needs to contain the scope parameter. You would now fire 
this event from any UI Component like this:

```kotlin
button("Load customers") {
   setOnAction {
       fire(CustomerListRequest(scope))
   }
}
```

The scope parameter from your `UIComponent` is passed into the CustomerListRequest. When customer data comes
back, you discriminate on scope and only apply the results if they are meant for your scope:

```kotlin
subscribe<CustomerListEvent> { event ->
   if (event.scope == scope)
       items.setAll(event.customers)
}
```
There is nothing special with the scope parameter compared to any other parameter you might provide to make sure you 
only apply relevant event data. In many cases the originating scope of the data might not be relevant as long
as other discriminators like `customerId` etc matches. This all depends on your use case and implementation.

## Invalidation of event subscribers

In many event bus implementations you are left with the task of deregistering the subscribers when your UI components
should no longer receive them. This is cumbersome and error prone, and TornadoFX takes an oppinionated approach
to event cleanup so you don't have to think about it much.

Subscriptions inside `UIComponents` like `View` and `Fragment` are only active when that component is docked
. That means that even if you have a `View` that has been previously initialized and used,
event subscriptions will not reach it unless the View is docked inside a window or some other component. Once
the view is docked, the events will reach it, and once it is undocked, the events will no longer be delivered to your
component. This takes care of the need for you to manually deregister subscribers when you discard of a view.

For `Controllers` however, subscriptions are always active until you call `unsubscribe`. You need to keep 
in mind that Controllers are lazy loaded, so if nothing references your controller, the subscriptions will
never be registered in the first place. If you have such a controller with no other references, but you want
it to subscribe to events right away, a good place to eagerly load it would be the `init` block of your `App` subclass:

```kotlin
class MyApp : App(MainView::class) {
    init {
        // Eagerly load CustomerController so it can receive events
        find<CustomerController>
    }
}
```

## Should I model my UI this way?

Using events for everything might seem like a nobel idea, and some people might prefer it because of the loose coupling 
it facilitates. However, this is more cumbersome than using the `ItemViewModel` with injection. This example
was provided to explain how the event system works, not to convince you to write your UIs this way.

In fact, there are several more relevant use cases for the event bus, which we will explore later.
