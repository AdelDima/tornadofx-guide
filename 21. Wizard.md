# Wizard

Some times you need to ask the user for a lot of information and asking for it all at once would result in a too complex
 user interface. Perhaps you also need to perform certain operations while or after you have requested the information.
 
 For these situations, you can consider using a wizard. A wizard typically has two or more pages. It lets the user
 navigate between the pages as well as complete or cancel the process.
 
 TornadoFX has a powerful and customizable Wizard component that lets you do just that. In the following example
 we need to create a new Customer and we have decided to ask for the basic customer info on the first page and the
 address information on the next.
 
Let's have a look at two simple input Views that gather said information from the user. The `BasicData` page
asks for the name of the customer and the type of customer (Person or Company). By now you can probably `CustomerModel`
guess how the `Customer` and `CustomerModel` objects look, so we won't repeat them here.

```kotlin
class BasicData : View("Basic Data") {
    val customer: CustomerModel by inject()

    override val root = form {
        fieldset(title) {
            field("Type") {
                combobox(customer.type, Customer.Type.values().toList())
            }
            field("Name") {
                textfield(customer.name).required()
            }
        }
    }
}

class AddressInput : View("Address") {
    val customer: CustomerModel by inject()

    override val root = form {
        fieldset(title) {
            field("Zip/City") {
                textfield(customer.zip) {
                    prefColumnCount = 5
                    required()
                }
                textfield(customer.city).required()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By themselves, these views don't do much, but put together in a Wizard we start to see how powerful this input
paradigm can be. Our initial Wizard code is only this:

```kotlin
class CustomerWizard : Wizard("Create customer", "Provide customer information") {
    val customer: CustomerModel by inject()

    init {
        graphic = resources.imageview("/graphics/customer.png")
        add(WizardStep1::class)
        add(WizardStep2::class)
    }
}
```

The result can be seen in Figure 21.1.

Just by looking at the Wizard the user can see what he will be asked to provide, how he can navigate between the pages
and how to complete or cancel the process.

Since the Wizard itself is basically just a normal `View`, it will respond to the `openModal` call. Let's imagine
a button that opens the Wizard:

```kotlin
button("Add Customer").action {
    find<CustomerWizard> {
        openModal()
    }
}
```

## Page navigation

By default, the `Back` and `Next` buttons are available whenever there are more pages either previous or next in the wizard.

 For `Next` navigation however, whether the wizard actually navigates to the next page is dependent upon the `completed` state
 of the current page. Every `View` has a `completed` property and a corresponding `isCompleted` variable you can manipulate.
 
 When the `Next` or `Finish` button is clicked, the `onSave` function of the current page is called, and the navigation
  action is only performed if the current page's `completed` value is `true`. Every `View` is completed by default,
  that's why we can navigate to page number two without completing page one first. Let's change that.
  
In the `BasicData` editor, we override the `onSave` function to perform a partial commit of the `name` and `type` fields,
because that's the only two fields the user can change on that page.

```kotlin
override fun onSave() {
    isComplete = customer.commit(customer.name, customer.type)
}
```

The commit function now controls the completed state of our wizard page, hence controller whether the user is allowed
to navigate to the address page. If we try to navigate without filling in the name, we will be granted by the
validation error message in Figure 21.2:

**Figure 21.2**
 
We could go on to do the same for the address editor, taking care to only commit the editable fields:

```kotlin
override fun onSave() {
    isComplete = customer.commit(customer.street, customer.zip, customer.city)
}
```

If the user clicks the Finish button, the `onSave` function in the Wizard itself is activated. If
the Wizard's `completed` state is true after the `onSave` call, the wizard dialog is closed, provided that
the user calls `super.onSave()`. In such a scenario, the Wizard itself needs to handle whatever should
happen in the `onSave` function. Another possibility is to configure a callback that will be executed
whenever the wizard is completed. With that approach, we need access the completed customer object somehow,
so we inject it into the wizard itself as well:

```kotlin
class CustomerWizard : Wizard() {
    val customer: CustomerModel by inject()
}
```

Let's revisit the button action that activated the wizard and add an `onComplete` callback that extracts
the customer and inserts it into a database before it opens the newly created Customer object in a CustomerEditor View:

```kotlin
button("Add Customer").action {
    find<CustomerWizard> {
        onComplete {
            runAsync {
                database.insert(customer.item)
            } ui {
                workspace.dockInNewScope<CustomerEditor>(customer.item)
            }
        }
        openModal()
    }
}
```

## Wizard scoping

In our example, both of the Wizard pages share a common view model, namely the `CustomerModel`. This model
is injected into both pages, so it should be the same instance. But what if other parts of the application
is already using the `CustomerModel` in the same scope we created the Wizard from? It turns out that this is
not even an issue, because the `Wizard` base class implements `InjectionScoped` which makes sure that whenever
you inject a `Wizard` subclass, a new scope is automatically activated. This makes sure that whatever resources
we require inside the Wizard will be unique and not shared with any other part of the application.

It also means that if you need to inject existing data into a Wizard's scope, you must do so manually:

```kotlin
val wizard = find<MyWizard>()
wizard.scope.set(someExistingObject)
wizard.openModal()
```
