# Config settings and state

Saving application state is a common requirement for desktop apps. TornadoFX has several features which facilitates saving of UI state, preferences and general app configuration settings.

## The `config` helper

Each component can have arbitrary configuration settings that will be saved as property files in a folder called `conf` inside the current program folder.

Below is a login screen example where login credentials are stored in the view specific config object.

```kotlin
class LoginScreen : View(), Initializable {
    override val root: BorderPane by fxml()
    val loginController: LoginController by inject()

    val usernameField: Label by fxid()
    val passwordField: Label by fxid()
    val loginButton: Button by fxid()

    init {
        usernameField.text = config.string("username")
        passwordField.text = config.string("password")

        loginButton.setOnAction {
            runAsync {
                loginController.tryLogin(usernameField.text, passwordField.text)
            } ui { success ->
                if (success) {

                    with(config) {
                        set("username" to usernameField.text)
                        set("password" to passwordField.text)
                        save()
                    }

                    showMainScreen()
                }
            }
        }
    }

    fun showMainScreen() {
        // hide LoginScreen and show the main UI of the application
    }

}
```
> Login screen with credentials stored in the view specific config object

The UI is defined in *FXML* and basically contains two textfields and a button. When the view is loaded, we assign username and password values from the config object. These values might be null at this point, if no prior successful login was performed.

We then define the action for the login button. Upon login, it calls the `loginController#tryLogin` function which takes the username and password from the input fields, calls out to the service and returns true or false.

If the result is true, we update the username and password in the config object and calls save on it. Finally, we call `showMainScreen` which could hide the login screen and show the main screen of the application.

_Please not that the example is not a best practise for storing sensitive data, it merely illustrates how you can use the config object._

## Data types and default values

`config` also supports other data types. It is a nice practise to wrap multiple operations on the config object in a `with` block.

```kotlin
// Assign to x, default to 50.0
var x = config.double("x", 50.0)

var showPrices = config.boolean("showPrices", boolean)

with (config) {
    set("x", root.layoutX)
    set("showPrices", showPrices)
    save()
}
```

## the `preferences` helper

As the `config` helper stores the information in a folder called `conf` per component (view, controller) the `preferences` helper will save settings into an OS specific way. In Windows systems they will be stored `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/JavaSoft/....` on Mac os in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.java.util.prefs.plist` and on Linux system in `~/.java`. Where the `config` helper saves per component. The `preferences` helper is meant to be used application wide:

```kotlin
preferences("application") {
   putBoolean("boolean", true)
   putString("String", "a string")
}
```
Retrieving preferences:

```kotlin
var bool: Boolean = false
var str: String = ""
preferences("test app") {
    bool = getBoolean("boolean key", false)
    str = get("string", "")
}
```

The `preferences` helper is a TornadoFX builder around [java.util.Preferences](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/preferences/overview.html)
