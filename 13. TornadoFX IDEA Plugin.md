# 14. TornadoFX IDEA Plugin

To save time in using TornadoFX, you can install a convenient Intellij IDEA plugin to automatically generate project templates, Views, injections, and other TornadoFX features. Of course, you do not have to use this plugin which was done throughout this book. But it adds some convenience to build TornadoFX applications a little more quickly. 

## Installing the Plugin

In the Intellij IDEA workspace, press <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> and type "Plugins", then press  <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. You will see a dialog to search and install plugins. Click the *Browse Repositories* button (Figure 14.1).

Wait for it to finish installing and the restart Intellij IDEA. 

### TornadoFX Project Templates

The TornadoFX plugins has some Maven and Gradle project templates to quickly create a configured TornadoFX application.

In Intellij IDEA, navigate to *File* -> *New* -> *Project...* (Figure 14.3).

You will then see a dialog to create a new TornadoFX project. You can create Gradle and Maven flavors, with or without OSGi support. Let's create a Gradle one for demonstration (Figure 14.4).

In the next dialog, give your project a name, a location folder, and a base package with your domain (Figure 14.5). Then click *Finish*.

You may be prompted to import the project as a Gradle project, and click on that prompt if you encounter it. You will then have a TornadoFX application configured and set up, including  `App`, `View`, and `Styles` entities set up (Figure 14.6).

These steps apply to the Maven and OSGi wizards as well, and do not forget to put your project on a version tracking system like GIT!. 


## Creating Views 

You can create Views, Fragments, and FXML files quickly with the plugin. You can right click a folder in the Project, then navigate the popup menu to *New* -> *TornadoFX View* (Figure 14.7).

You will then come to a dialog to dictate how the `View` is constructed. You even have the option of specifying it as a `Fragment` instead through  the *Type* parameter, as well as an FXML via *Kind*. Finally, you can specify the `Node` type for the *Root*, which should default to a `BorderPane`.

Click *OK* and a new`View` will generated and added to your project (Figure 14.9).

## Injecting Components

One last minor convenience. You can generate TornadoFX `Component` injections quickly with the plugin. For instance, if you right click the class body of the `MainView`, you can generate the  `MyOtherView` as an injected property (Figure 14.10).

You can then use a dialog to select the `MyOtherView` as the injected property, then click *OK* (Figure 14.11).

## Summary

The TornadoFX plugin has some time-saving conveniences that you are welcome to take advantage of. Of course, you do not have to use the plugin because it merely provides shortcuts and generates code. In time, there may be more features added to the plugin so be sure to follow the project on GitHub for future developments.
