# 14. TornadoFX IDEA Plugin

To save time in using TornadoFX, you can install a convenient Intellij IDEA plugin to automatically generate project templates, Views, injections, and other TornadoFX features. Of course, you do not have to use this plugin which was done throughout this book. But it adds some convenience to build TornadoFX applications a little more quickly. 

### Installing the Plugin

In Intellij IDEA, press <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> and type "Plugins", then press  <kbd>ENTER<kbd>. You will see a dialog to search and install plugins.
