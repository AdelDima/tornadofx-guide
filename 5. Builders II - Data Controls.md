# Builders Part II - Data Controls

Any significant application works with data, and providing a means for users to view, manipulate, and modify data is not a trivial task for user interface development. Fortunately, TornadoFX streamlines many JavaFX data controls such as `ListView`, `TableView`, `TreeView`, and `TreeTableView`. These controls can be cumbersome to set up in a purely object-oriented way. But using builders through functional declarations, we can code all these controls in a much more streamlined way.

### ListView

A `ListView` is similar to a `ComboBox` but it displays all items within a `ScrollView` and has the option of allowing multiple selections, as shown in Figure 5.1

```kotlin
listview<String> {
    items.add("Alpha")
    items.add("Beta")
    items.add("Gamma")
    items.add("Delta")
    items.add("Epsilon")
    selectionModel.selectionMode = SelectionMode.MULTIPLE
}
```

**Figure 5.1**

You can also provide it an `ObservableList` of items up front and omit the type declaration since it can be inferred.

```kotlin
val greekLetters = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha","Beta",
        "Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")

listview(greekLetters) {
    selectionModel.selectionMode = SelectionMode.MULTIPLE
}
```

Like most data controls, keep in mind that by default, the `ListView` will call `toString()` to render the text for each item in your domain class.

#### Custom Cell formatting

Even though the default look of a ListView is rather boring you can modify it so that every cell is a custom Node of your choosing. TornadoFX provides a convenient way to override what kind of Node is returned for each item in your list:

```kotlin
listview(persons) {
    cellCache {
        hbox {
            form {
                fieldset {
                    field("Name") {
                        label(it.name)
                    }
                    field("Birthday") {
                        label(it.age)
                    }
                }
            }
            label("${it.age} YEARS") {
                alignment = Pos.CENTER_RIGHT
                style {
                    fontSize = 22.px
                    fontWeight = BOLD
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `cellCache` function lets you create a reusable and cached Node for each item in your list and it automatically assigns that Node to the graphic property of the cell whenever it is shown on screen. This is great for performance and requires no boiler plate to manage. 

### TableView

Probably one of the most significant builders in TornadoFX is the one for `TableView`. If you have worked with JavaFX, you might have experienced building a `TableView` in an object-oriented way. But TornadoFX provides a functional declaration construct pattern using extension functions that greatly simplifies the coding of a `TableView`.

Say you have a domain type, such as `Person`.

```kotlin
class Person(val id: Int, val name: String, val birthday: LocalDate) {
    val age: Int get() = Period.between(birthday, LocalDate.now()).years
}
```

Take several instances of `Person` and put them in an `ObservableList`.

```kotlin
private val persons = FXCollections.observableArrayList<Person>(
        Person(1,"Samantha Stuart",LocalDate.of(1981,12,4)),
        Person(2,"Tom Marks",LocalDate.of(2001,1,23)),
        Person(3,"Stuart Gills",LocalDate.of(1989,5,23)),
        Person(3,"Nicole Williams",LocalDate.of(1998,8,11))
)
```

You can quickly declare a `TableView` with all of its columns using a functional construct, and specify the `items` property to an `ObservableList<Person>` (Figure 5.2).

```kotlin
tableview<Person> {
    items = persons
    column("ID",Person::id)
    column("Name", Person::name)
    column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
    column("Age",Person::age)
}
```

**Figure 5.2**

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/21d91e000f36556b67bea322ff1152199aee483e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f41474d435038532e706e67)



The `column()` functions are extension functions for `TableView` accepting a `header` and a mapped property using reflection syntax.

#### Using "Property" properties

If you follow the JavaFX `Property` conventions to set up your domain class, it will automatically support value editing.

You can create these `Property` objects the conventional way, or you can use TornadoFX's `property` delegates to automatically create these `Property` declarations as shown below.

```kotlin
class Person(id: Int, name: String, birthday: LocalDate) {
    var id by property(id)
    fun idProperty() = getProperty(Person::id)

    var name by property(name)
    fun nameProperty() = getProperty(Person::name)

    var birthday by property(birthday)
    fun birthdayProperty() = getProperty(Person::birthday)

    val age: Int get() = Period.between(birthday, LocalDate.now()).years
}
```

You need to create `xxxProperty()` functions for each property to support JavaFX's naming convention when it uses reflection. This can easily be done by relaying their calls to `getProperty()` to retrieve the `Property` for a given field. See Appendix A1 for detailed information on how these property delegates work.

If you don't care about exposing the property in a function (as JavaFX properties commonly are) you can write it like this:

```kotlin
class Person(id: Int, name: String, birthday: LocalDate) {
    val idProperty = SimpleIntegerProperty(id)
    var id by idProperty

    val nameProperty = SimpleStringProperty(name)
    var name by nameProperty

    val birthdayProperty = SimpleObjectProperty(birthday)
    var birthday by birthdayProperty

    val age: Int get() = Period.between(birthday, LocalDate.now()).years
}
```

The alternative version exposes the property as a field member instead of a function. If you like the above syntax but want to keep the function, you can make the property private and add the function like this:

```kotlin
private val nameProperty = SimpleStringProperty(name)
fun nameProperty() = nameProperty
var name by nameProperty
```

These options are all a matter of taste, you can use whatever version meets your needs or preferences best.

> You can also convert plain properties to JavaFX properties using the TornadoFX Plugin. Refer to Chapter 13 to learn how to do this.

#### Using cellFormat()

There are other extension functions applied to `TableView` that can assist the flow of declaring a `TableView`. For instance, you can call a `cellFormat()` function on a given column to apply formatting rules, such as highlighting "Age" values less than 18 (Figure 5.3).

```kotlin
tableview<Person> {
    items = persons
    column("ID", Person::id)
    column("Name", Person::name)
    column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
    column("Age", Person::age).cellFormat {
        text = it.toString()
        style {
            if (it < 18) {
                backgroundColor += c("#8b0000")
                textFill = Color.WHITE
            }
        }
     }
}
```

**Figure 5.3**

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dbc9a172be484e4ab8eeb0accc3799500e9fe791/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4d7932475545762e706e67)

#### Declaring Column Values Functionally

If you need to map a column's value to a non-property (such as a function), you can use a non-reflection means to extract the values for that column.

Say you have a `WeeklyReport` type that has a `getTotal()` function accepting a `DayOfWeek` argument (an enum of Monday, Tuesday... Sunday).

```kotlin
abstract class WeeklyReport(val startDate: LocalDate) {
    abstract fun getTotal(dayOfWeek: DayOfWeek): BigDecimal
}
```

Let's say you wanted to create a column for each `DayOfWeek`. You cannot map to properties, but you can map each `WeeklyReport` item explicitly to extract each value for that `DayOfWeek`.

```kotlin
tableview<WeeklyReport> {
    for (dayOfWeek in DayOfWeek.values()) {
        column<WeeklyReport, BigDecimal>(dayOfWeek.toString()) {
            ReadOnlyObjectWrapper(it.value.getTotal(dayOfWeek))
        }
    }
}
```
>This more closely resembles the traditional `setCellValueFactory()` for the  JavaFX `TableColumn`.

#### Row Expanders

Later we will learn about the `TreeTableView` which has a notion of "parent" and "child" rows. But the constraint with this control is the parent and child must have the same columns. Fortunately, TornadoFX comes with an awesome utility to not only reveal a "child table" for a given row, but any kind of `Node` control.

Say we have two types: `Region` and `Branch`. A `Region` is a geographical zone, and it contains one or more `Branch` items which are specific business operation locations (warehouses, distribution centers, etc).  Here is a declaration of these types and some given instances.

```kotlin
class Region(val id: Int, val name: String, val country: String, val branches: ObservableList<Branch>)

class Branch(val id: Int, val facilityCode: String, val city: String, val stateProvince: String)

val regions = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
        Region(1,"Pacific Northwest", "USA",FXCollections.observableArrayList(
                Branch(1,"D","Seattle","WA"),
                Branch(2,"W","Portland","OR")
        )),
        Region(2,"Alberta", "Canada",FXCollections.observableArrayList(
                Branch(3,"W","Calgary","AB")
        )),
        Region(3,"Midwest", "USA",FXCollections.observableArrayList(
                Branch(4,"D","Chicago","IL"),
                Branch(5,"D","Frankfort","KY"),
                Branch(6, "W","Indianapolis", "IN")
        ))
)
```

We can create a `TableView` where each row has a `rowExpander()` function defined, and there we can arbitrarily create any `Node` control built off that particular row's item. In this case, we can nest another `TableView` for a given `Region` to show all the `Branch` items belonging to it. It will have a "+" button column to expand and show this expanded control (Figure 5.4).

**Figure 5.4**

![](http://i.imgur.com/nXbjGpu.png)

There are a few configurability options, like "expand on double-click" behaviors and accessing the `expanderColumn` (the column with the "+" button) to drive a padding (Figure 5.5).

```kotlin
override val root = tableview(regions) {
        column("ID",Region::id)
        column("Name", Region::name)
        column("Country", Region::country)
        rowExpander(expandOnDoubleClick = true) {
            paddingLeft(expanderColumn.width)
            tableview(it.branches) {
                column("ID",Branch::id)
                column("Facility Code",Branch::facilityCode)
                column("City",Branch::city)
                column("State/Province",Branch::stateProvince)
            }
        }
 }
 ```

 **Figure 5.5**

![](http://i.imgur.com/DVco56O.png)

Again, the `rowExpander()` function does not have to return a `TableView` but any kind of control, including Forms.


## SmartResize Policy

The SmartResize policy brings the ability to resize columns intuitively by providing sensible defaults combined with powerful and dynamic configuration options.


#### Usage

To apply the resize policy to a TableView we configure the `columnResizePolicy` of the table. For this discussion we will use a list of hotel rooms. This is our initial table with the SmartResize Policy activated:

```kotlin
tableview(rooms) {
    column("#", Room::id)
    column("Number", Room::number)
    column("Type", Room::type)
    column("Bed", Room::bed)

    columnResizePolicy = SmartResize.POLICY
}
```

Here is a picture of the table with the SmartResize policy activated:

 **Figure 5.6**

![](http://i.imgur.com/chugPrR.png)

The default settings gave each column the space it needs based on it's content and gave the remaining width to the last column. When you resize a column by dragging the divider between column headers, only the column immediately to the right will be affected, to avoid pushing the columns to the right outside the viewport of the TableView.

While this often presents a pleasant default, there is a lot more we can do to improve user experience in our particular case. It is evident that our table didn't need the full 800 pixels it was provided, but it gives us a nice chance to elaborate on the configuration options of the SmartResize policy.

The bed column is way too big, and it seems more sensible to give the extra space to the **Type** column, since it might contain arbitrary long descriptions of the room. To give the extra space to the **Type** column, we change it's column definition:

```kotlin
column("Type", Room::type).remainingWidth()
```

 **Figure 5.7**

![](http://i.imgur.com/fHgkqnZ.png)

Now it becomes apparent that the **Bed** column looks cramped, being pushed all the way to the left. We configure it to keep it's desired width based on the content plus 50 pixels padding:

```kotlin
column("Bed", Room:bed").contentWidth(padding = 50.0)
```

The result is a much more pleasant visual impression:

 **Figure 5.8**
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/O0VeONz.png)

These things might not seem like much, but it means a lot to people who are forced to stare at your software all day!

If the user increases the width of the **Number** column, the **Type** column will gradually decrease in width, until it reaches it's default width of 10 pixels (JavaFX default). After that, the **Bed** column must start giving away it's space. We don't ever want the **Bed** column to be smaller that what we configured, so we tell it to use it's content based width plus the padding we added as it's minimal width:

```kotlin
column("Bed", Room:bed").contentWidth(padding = 50.0, useAsMin = true)
```

Trying to decrease the **Bed** column either by explicitly expanding the **Type** column or implicitly by expanding the **Number** column will simply be denied by the resize policy. It is worth noting that there is also a `useAsMax` choice for the `contentWidth` resize type. This would effectively result in a hard coded, unresizable column, based on the required content width plus any configured padding. That would be a good way to go for the **#** column:

```kotlin
column("#", Room::id).contentWidth(useAsMin = true, useAsMax = true)
```

The rest of the examples will probably not benefit the user of our example view, but we still have more configuration options to cover, so let's try to make the **Number** column 25% of the total table width:

```kotlin
column("Number", Room::number).pctWidth(25.0)
```

When you resize the tableview, the **Number** column will gradually expand to keep up with our 25% width requirement, while the **Type** column gets the remaining extra space.

 **Figure 5.9**
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/NP04XNd.png)

An alternative approach to percentage width is to specify a weight. This time we add weights to both **Number** and **Type**:

```kotlin
column("Number", Room::number).weigthedWidth(1.0)
column("Type", Room::type).weigthedWidth(3.0)
```

The two weighted columns share the remaining space after the other columns have received their fair share, and since the **Type** column has a weight that is three times bigger than the **Number** column, it's size will be three times bigger as well, and this will be reevaluated as the tableview itself is resized.

 **Figure 5.10**
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/lm47oxU.png)

This setting will make sure we keep the mentioned ratio between the two columns, but it might become problematic if the Table View is resized to be very small. The the **Number** column would not have space to show all of it's content, so we guard against that by specifying that it should never grow below the space it needs to show it's content, plus some padding, for good measure:

```kotlin
column("Number", Room::number).weigthedWidth(1.0, minContentWidth = true, padding = 10.0)
```

This makes sure our table behaves nicely also under constrained width conditions.

#### Dynamic content resizing

Since some of the resizing modes are based on the actual content of the columns, they might need to be reevaluated even when the table or it's columns aren't resized. For example, if you add or remove content items from the backing list, the required content measurements might need to be updated. For this you can call the `requestResize` function after you have manipulated the items:

```kotlin
SmartResize.POLICY.requestResize(tableView)
```

In fact, you can ask the TableView to ask the policy for you:

```kotlin
tableView.requestResize()
```

#### Statically setting the content width

In most cases you probably want to configure your column widths based on either the total available space or the content of the columns. In some cases you might want to configure a specific width, that that can be done with the `prefWidth` function:

```kotlin
column("Bed", Room::bed).prefWidth(200.0)
```

A column with a preferred width can be resized, so to make it non-resizable, use the `fixedWidth` function instead:

```kotlin
column("Bed", Room::bed).fixedWidth(200.0)
```

When you hard code the width of the columns you will most likely end up with some extra space. This space will be awarded to the right most resizable column, unless you specify `remainingWidth()` for one or more column. In that case, these columns will divide the extra space between them.

In the case where not all columns can be afforded their preferred width, all resizable columns must give away some of their space, but the SmartResize Policy makes sure that the column with the biggest reduction potential will give away it's space first. The reduction potential is the difference between the current width of the column and it's defined minimum width.


### TreeView

The `TreeView` contains elements where each element may contain child elements. Typically arrows allow you to expand a parent element to see its children. For istance, we can nest employees under department names

Traditionally in JavaFX, populating these elements is rather cumbersome and verbose. Fortunately TornadoFX makes it relatively simple.

Say you have a simple type `Person` and an `ObservableList` containing several instances.

```kotlin

data class Person(val name: String, val department: String)

val persons = listOf(
        Person("Mary Hanes","Marketing"),
        Person("Steve Folley","Customer Service"),
        Person("John Ramsy","IT Help Desk"),
        Person("Erlick Foyes","Customer Service"),
        Person("Erin James","Marketing"),
        Person("Jacob Mays","IT Help Desk"),
        Person("Larry Cable","Customer Service")
        )
```

Creating a `TreeView` with the `treeview()` builder can be done functionally Figure 5.6).

```kotlin
// Create Person objects for the departments
// with the department name as Person.name

val departments = persons
    .map { it.department }
    .distinct().map { Person(it, "") }

treeview<Person> {
    // Create root item
    root = TreeItem(Person("Departments", ""))

    // Make sure the text in each TreeItem is the name of the Person
    cellFormat { text = it.name }

    // Generate items. Children of the root item will contain departments
    populate { parent ->
        if (parent == root) departments else persons.filter { it.department == parent.value.name }
    }
}
```

**Figure 5.11**

![](http://i.imgur.com/jptTFqZ.png)

Let's break this down:

```kotlin
val departments = persons
    .map { it.department }
    .distinct().map { Person(it, "") }
```

First we gather a distinct list of all the `departments` derived from the `persons` list. But then we put each `department` String in a `Person` object since the `TreeView` only accepts `Person` elements. While this is not very intuitive, this is the constraint and design of `TreeView`. We must make each `department` a `Person` for it to be accepted.

```kotlin
treeview<Person> {
    // Create root item
    root = TreeItem(Person("Departments", ""))
```

Next we specify the highest `root` for the `TreeView` that all departments will be nested under, and we give it a placeholder `Person` called "Departments".

```kotlin
    cellFormat { text = it.name }
```

Then we specify the `cellFormat()` to render the `name` of each `Person` (including departments) on each cell.

```kotlin
   populate { parent ->
        if (parent == root) departments else persons.filter { it.department == parent.value.name }
    }
```

Finally, we call the `populate()` function and provide a block instructing how to provide children to each `parent`. If the `parent` is indeed the `root`, then we return the `departments`. Otherwise the `parent` is a `department` and we provide a list of `Person` objects belonging to that `department.

#### TreeView with Differing Types

It is not necessarily intuitive to make every entity in the previous example a `Person`. We made each department a `Person` as well as the `root` "Departments". For a more complex `TreeView<T>` where `T` is unknown and can be any number of types, it is better to leverage [star projection](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/generics.html#star-projections) for type `T`.

Using star projection, you can safely populate multiple types nested into the `TreeView`.

For instance, you can create a `Department` type and leverage `cellFormat()` to utilize type-checking for rendering. Then you can use a `populate()` function that will iterate over each element, and you specify the children for each element (if any).

```kotlin
data class Department(val name: String)

// Create Department objects for the departments by getting distinct values from Person.department
val departments = persons.map { it.department }.distinct().map { Department(it) }

// Type safe way of extracting the correct TreeItem text
cellFormat {
    text = when (it) {
        is String -> it
        is Department -> it.name
        is Person -> it.name
        else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid value type")
    }
}

// Generate items. Children of the root item will contain departments, children of departments are filtered
populate { parent ->
    val value = parent.value
    if (parent == root) departments
    else if (value is Department) persons.filter { it.department == value.name }
    else null
}
```

###TreeTableView

The `TreeTableView` operates and functions similarly to a `TreeView`, but it has multiple columns since it is a table.

Say you have a `Person` class that optionally has an `employees` parameter, which defaults to an empty `List<Person>` if nobody reports to that `Person`.



```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, val department: String, val email: String, val employees: List<Person> = emptyList())

```

Then you have an `ObservableList<Person>` holding instances of this class.

```kotlin
val persons = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
        Person("Mary Hanes", "IT Administration", "mary.hanes@contoso.com", listOf(
            Person("Jacob Mays", "IT Help Desk", "jacob.mays@contoso.com"),
            Person("John Ramsy", "IT Help Desk", "john.ramsy@contoso.com"))),
        Person("Erin James", "Human Resources", "erin.james@contoso.com", listOf(
            Person("Erlick Foyes", "Customer Service", "erlick.foyes@contoso.com"),
            Person("Steve Folley", "Customer Service", "steve.folley@contoso.com"),
            Person("Larry Cable", "Customer Service", "larry.cable@contoso.com")))
)
```

You can create a `TreeTableView` by merging the declarations needed for a `TableView` and `TreeView` together. You will need to call the `populate()` function needs to be provided as well as the root `TreeItem`.

```kotlin
val treeTableView = TreeTableView<Person>().apply {
    column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
    column("Department", Person::departmentProperty)
    column("Email", Person::emailProperty)

    /// Create the root item that holds all top level employees
    root = TreeItem(Person("Employees by leader", "", "", persons))

    // Always return employees under the current person
    populate { it.value.employees }

    // Expand the two first levels
    root.isExpanded = true
    root.children.forEach { it.isExpanded = true }

    // Resize to display all elements on the first two levels
    resizeColumnsToFitContent()
}
```


It is also possible to work with more of an ad hoc backing store like a Map. That would look something like this:

```kotlin
val tableData = mapOf(
    "Fruit" to arrayOf("apple", "pear", "Banana"),
    "Veggies" to arrayOf("beans", "cauliflower", "cale"),
    "Meat" to arrayOf("poultry", "pork", "beef")
)

treetableview<String>(TreeItem("Items")) {
    column<String, String>("Type", { it.value.valueProperty() })
    populate {
        if (it.value == "Items") tableData.keys
        else tableData[it.value]?.asList()
    }
}
```

### DataGrid

A `DataGrid` is similar to the `GridPane` in that it displays items in a flexible grid of rows and columns, but the 
similarities ends there. While the `GridPane` requires you to add Nodes to the children list, the `DataGrid` is data driven
in the same way as `TableView` and `ListView`. You supply it with a list of items and tell it how to convert those
children to a graphical representation.

It supports selection of either a single item or multiple items at a time so it can be used as for example the display
of an image viewer or other components where you want a visual representation of the underlying data. Usage wise it is close
to a `ListView`, but you can create an arbitrary scene graph inside each cell so it's easy to visualize multiple properties
for each item.

```kotlin
val kittens = listOf("http://i.imgur.com/DuFZ6PQb.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/o2QoeNnb.jpg") // more items here

datagrid(kittens) {
    cellCache { 
         imageview(it)
    }
}
```

The `cellCache` function receives each item in the list, and since we used a list of Strings in our example, we simply
pass that string to the imageview builder to create an `ImageView` inside each table cell. It is important to call the `cellCache` 
function instead of the `cellFormat` function to avoid recreating the images every time the DataGrid redraws.

Let's create a scene graph that is a little bit more involved, and also change the default size of each cell:

```kotlin
val numbers = (1..10).toList()

datagrid(numbers) {
    cellHeight = 75.0
    cellWidth = 75.0

    multiSelect = true

    cellCache {
        stackpane {
            circle(radius = 25.0) {
                fill = Color.FORESTGREEN
            }
            label(it.toString())
        }
    }
}
```

The grid is supplied with a list of numbers this time. We start by specifying a cell height and width of 75 pixels, half of
the default size. We also configure multi select to be able to select more than a single element. This is a short form
of writing `selectionModel.selectionMode = SelectionMode.MULTIPLE`. We create a `StackPane` that stacks a label on top of a
circle. 

#### CSS Styleable properties

You  might wonder why the label got so big and bold by default? This is also coming from the [default
stylesheet](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/blob/master/src/main/resources/tornadofx/datagrid.css) as well. The stylesheet
is a good starting point for further customization. All properties of the data grid can be configured in code as well
as in CSS, and the stylesheet lists all possible style properties.

#### Selection

The number list showcased multiple selection. When a cell is selected, it receives the CSS pseudo class of `selected`. By default
it will behave mostly like a `ListView` row with regards to selection styles. You can access the `selectionModel` of
the data grid to listen for selection changes, see what items are selected etc.

### Summary

Functional constructs work well with data controls like `TableView`, `TreeView`, and others we have seen in this chapter. Using the builder patterns, you can quickly and functionally declare how data is displayed.

In the next chapter, we will embed controls in layouts to create more complex UI's easily.
