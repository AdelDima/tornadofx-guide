#Introduction

User interfaces are becoming increasingly critical to the success of consumer and business applications. With the rise of consumer mobile apps and web applications, business users are increasingly holding enterprise applications to a higher standard.  They want rich, feature-packed user interfaces that provide immediate insight and navigate complex information intuitively. More importantly, they want the application to adapt quickly to business changes on a frequent basis. For the developer, this means the application must not only be maintainable but also evolvable. 

While much of the enterprise IT world is pushing HTML5 and cloud-based applications, many businesses are still using desktop UI frameworks like JavaFX. While it doesn't distribute to large audiences as easily as web applications, JavaFX works well for "in-house" business applications. Its high-performance with large datasets (and the fact it is native Java) make it a practical choice for applications used behind the corporate firewall.

JavaFX, like many UI frameworks, can be built on verbose codebases and be difficult to maintain. Fortunately, the release of Kotlin has created an opportunity rethink how JavaFX applications are built.

#Why TornadoFX? 
In February 2016, JetBrains released [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org), a new JVM language that emphasizes pragmatism over convention. Kotlin works at a higher level of abstraction and provides practical language features not available in Java. One of the more important features of Kotlin is its 100% interoperability with existing Java libraries and codebases, including JavaFX.

While JavaFX can be used with Kotlin in the same manner as Java, some believed Kotlin had language features that could streamline and simplify JavaFX development. Well before Kotlin's beta, Eugen Kiss prototyped JavaFX "builders" with KotlinFX. In January 2016, Edvin Syse rebooted the initiative and released TornadoFX. 

TornadoFX seeks to greatly minimize the amount of code needed to build JavaFX applications. It not only includes type-safe builders to quickly lay out controls and user interfaces, but also features dependency injection, delegated properties, control extension functions, and other practical features enabled by Kotlin. TornadoFX is a fine showcase of how Kotlin can simplify codebases, and it tackles the verbosity of UI code with elegance and simplicity. It can work in conjunction with other popular JavaFX libraries such as [ControlsFX](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) and [JFExtras](http://jfxtras.org/). It works especially* well with reactive frameworks such as [ReactFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX) as well as [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and friends (including [RxJavaFX](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX), [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin), and [RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX)). 


#A Motivational Example
If you have worked with JavaFX before, you might have created a `TableView` at some point. With TornadoFX, you can build an entire "`View`" containing a `TableView` with a small code footprint.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    private val persons = FXCollections.observableArrayList<Person>(
            Person(1,"Samantha Stuart",LocalDate.of(1981,12,4)),
            Person(2,"Tom Marks",LocalDate.of(2001,1,23)),
            Person(3,"Stuart Gills",LocalDate.of(1989,5,23)),
            Person(3,"Nicole Williams",LocalDate.of(1998,8,11))
    )

    init {
        with(root) {
            tableview<Person> {
                items = persons
                column("ID",Person::id)
                column("Name", Person::name)
                column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
                column("Age",Person::age)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**RENDERED OUTPUT:**

Half of that code was just initializing sample data! If you hone in on just the part declaring the `TableView` with four columns, you will see it took very little code.

```kotlin
tableview<Person> {
    items = persons
    column("ID",Person::id)
    column("Name", Person::name)
    column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
    column("Age",Person::age)
}
```

Using the `cellFormat()` extension function on a `TableColumn`, we can even create conditional formatting for "Age" values that are less than `18`.

```kotlin
tableview<Person> {
	items = persons
	column("ID",Person::id)
	column("Name", Person::name)
	column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
	column("Age",Person::age).cellFormat {
		if (it < 18) {
			style = "-fx-background-color:#8b0000; -fx-text-fill:white"
			text = it.toString()
		} else {
			text = it.toString()
		}
	}
}
```

These declarations are pure Kotlin code, and TornadoFX is packed with expressive power for dozens of cases like this. This allows you to focus on creating solutions rather than engineering UI code. Your JavaFX applications will not only be turned around more quickly, but also be maintainable and evolvable.
