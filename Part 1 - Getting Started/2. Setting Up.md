#Setting Up

To use TornadoFX, there are several options to set up the dependency for your project. Mainstream build automation tools like [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) are supported. 

Please note that TornadoFX is a Kotlin library, and therefore your project needs to be configured to use Kotlin. For Gradle and Maven configurations, please refer to the [Kotlin Gradle Setup](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) and [Kotlin Maven Setup](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html) guides. Make sure your development environment or IDE is equipped to work with Kotlin and has the proper plugins and compilers.

This guide will use Intellij IDEA to walk through certain examples. IDEA is the IDE of choice to work with Kotlin, although Eclipse has a plugin as well.

##Gradle

For Gradle, you can set up the dependency directly from Maven Central. Provide the desired version number for the  `x.y.z` placeholder.

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral() 
}
dependencies { 
    compile 'no.tornado:tornadofx:x.y.z'
}
```

##Maven
To import TornadoFX with Maven, add the following dependency to your POM file. Provide the desired version number for the  `x.y.z` placeholder.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>no.tornado</groupId>
    <artifactId>tornadofx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

###Other Build Automation Solutions
For instructions on how to use TornadoFX with other build automation solutions, please refer to the [TornadoFX page at the Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22no.tornado%22%20AND%20a%3A%22tornadofx%22)

##Manual Import
To manually download and import the JAR file, go to the [TornadoFX release page](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/releases) or the [Central Repository](search.maven.org). Download the JAR file and configure it into your project. 

Note that TornadoFX needs a few dependencies, and you will manually need to download and import these into your project. Refer to the project's `pom.xml` file to see these needed libraries.
