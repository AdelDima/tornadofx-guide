#Setting Up

To use TornadoFX, there are several options to set up the library as a dependency. 


##Gradle

For Gradle, you can set up the dependency directly from Maven Central. `x.y.z` is a placeholder for the version number provided by you. 

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral() 
}
dependencies { 
    compile 'no.tornado:tornadofx:x.y.z'
}
```

##Maven
To import TornadoFX with Maven, add the following dependency to your POM file. 

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>no.tornado</groupId>
    <artifactId>tornadofx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```
