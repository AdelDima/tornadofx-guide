# Workspaces

Java Business applications have traditionally been based on one of the the Rich Client Frameworks,
namely NetBeans Platform or Eclipse RCP. An important reason for choosing an RCP platform has been the
workspace like functionality they provide. Some important features of a workspace are:

- Common action buttons that tie to the state of the docked view (Save, Refresh etc)
- Context based UI nodes added to the common workspace interface
- Navigation stack for traversing visited views, like a web browser's back and forward buttons
- Menu system with dynamic contributions and modifications

TornadoFX has begun to bridge the gap between the RCP platforms by providing Workspaces.
