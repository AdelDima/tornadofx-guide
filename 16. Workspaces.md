# Workspaces

Java Business applications have traditionally been based on one of the the Rich Client Frameworks,
namely NetBeans Platform or Eclipse RCP. An important reason for choosing an RCP platform has been the
workspace like functionality they provide. Some important features of a workspace are:

- Common action buttons that tie to the state of the docked view (Save, Refresh etc)
- Context based UI nodes added to the common workspace interface
- Navigation stack for traversing visited views, controlled through back and forward buttons like a web browser
- Menu system with dynamic contributions and modifications

TornadoFX has begun to bridge the gap between the RCP platforms by providing Workspaces. While still in it's infancy,
the default functionality is a solid foundation for business applications in need of the features discussed above.

## The simplest possible Workspace app

To kick off a Workspace app, all you need to do is to subclass `App` and set the primary `View` to `Workspace::class`.
The result can be seen below (Figure 16.1).

```kotlin
class MyApp : App(Workspace::class)
```

**Figure 16.1**

The resulting Workspace consists of a button bar with four default buttons and an empty content area below it.
The content area can house any `UIComponent`. You add a component to the `content` area by calling `workspace.dock()` on it. If you
show the Workspace without a docked View, it will by default only take up the space needed for the buttons. The window in Figure 16.1
was resized after it was opened.

Let's pretend we have a `CustomerList` component that we would like to dock in the Workspace as the application starts.
We do this by overriding the `onBeforeShow` callback:


```kotlin
class MyApp : App(Workspace::class) {
    override fun onBeforeShow(view: UIComponent) {
        workspace.dock<CustomerList>()
    }
}
```

**Figure 16.2**

The complete code of the Customer List is not important for us, suffice it to say that it displays a TableView and
lists some Customers. What is interesting however, is that the **Refresh** button in the Workspace was enabled
when the `CustomerList` was docked, while the **Save** button remained disabled.

### Leveraging the Workspace buttons

Whenever a `UIComponent` is docked in the Workspace, the **Refresh** and **Save** buttons will enable by default. This happens
because the Workspace looks at the `refreshable` and `savable` properties in the docked component. Every `UIComponent` 
returns a boolean property with the default value of `true`, which the Workspace then connects to the enabled state of
these buttons. In the `CustomerList` example, we made sure the **Save** button was always disabled by overriding this property:

```
override val savable = SimpleBooleanProperty(false)
```

We can achieve the same result by calling `disableSave()` in the `init` block, same goes for `disableRefresh()`.

We didn't touch the `refreshable` property, so it remains `true` as per the default. Whenever the `Refresh` button
is called, it will fire the `onRefresh` function in the `View`. You can override this to provide your refresh action:

```
override val onRefresh() {
    customerTable.asyncItems { customerController.listCustomers() }
}
```

We will revisit the **Save** button and introduce a neat trick to only activate it when there are dirty changes later in this chapter.

### Modifying the default workspace

The default workspace only gives you basic functionality. As your application grows you will want to suplement the
 toolbar with more buttons and controls, and maybe a `MenuBar` above it. For small modifications you can augment
 it in the `onBeforeFunction` as we did above, but you will most probably want to subclass as the customizations
 become more advanced. The following code and image is taken from a real world CRM application:
 
```kotlin
class CRMWorkspace : Workspace() {
    init {
        add(MainMenu::class)
        add(RestProgressBar::class)
        add(SearchView::class)
    }
}
```

The `CRMWorkspace` loads three other views into it. One providing a `MenuBar`, then the default `RestProgressBar` is
added, and lastly a `SearchView` providing a search input field is added. 

The Workspace has a pretty good idea about where to place whatever you add to it. For example, buttons will by default
be added after the four default buttons, while other components are added to the far right of the ToolBar. The MenuBar
is automatically added above the ToolBar, at the top of the screen.

Figure 16.3 shows how it looks in production, with a little bit of custom styling and a `CustomerEditor` docked into it.
This application happens to be in Norwegian, and some of the information in the Customer card has been removed.

**Figure 16.3** 

![](http://i.imgur.com/BbqCYg9.png)

You will notice that the **Save** button is enabled in this View. This is becausethe `savable` property is bound to
the dirty state property of the view model:

```kotlin
val model: CustomerModel by inject()
override val savable = model.dirty
```

When a customer is loaded, the **Save** button will stay disabled until an edit has been made. To save, we override the `onSave` function:

```kotlin
override fun onSave() {
    runAsync {
        customerController.save(customer.item)
    } ui { saved ->
        customer.update(saved)    
    }
}
```

This particular `customerController.save` call will return the `Customer` from the server once it is saved. If the server made any changes
to our customer object, they would have been reflected in the saved customer we got back. For that reason, we call
`customer.update(saved)` which is function you get for free if you implement `JsonModel`. This makes sure that changes
from the server is pushed back into the model. This is completely optional, and you might just want to do `customerController.save(customer.item)`.

## Title and heading

When a view is docked, the title of the Workspace will match the title of that view. There is also a heading
text in the workspace that by default shows the same text as the title. The heading can be overriden by assigning to
the `heading` variable or binding to the `headingProperty` property. If you want to completely remove the heading, augment
the workspace with `workspace.headingContainer.removeFromParent()` or just hide it. You can also put whatever
nodes you want inside the heading container. You saw this trick in the CRM screenshot, where a Gravator icon was placed
to the left of the customer name.

## Dynamic elements in the ToolBar

Some views might need more buttons or functionality added to the ToolBar, but once you navigate away from the view it
wouldn't make sense to keep them around. The Workspace will actually track whatever elements you add to it while a view is
docked and remove those changes when the view is undocked. The perfect place to add these extra buttons would be the `onDock`
call of the view.

Every `UIComponent` has a property called `workspace` which will point to the current Workspace for the current Scope. Let's
add an "Add Customer" button to the Workspace whenever the `CustomerList` is docked:

```kotlin
override fun onDock() {
    with (workspace) {
        button("Add Customer") {
            setOnAction { addCustomer() }
        }
    }
}
```

The Workspace will now look like in Figure **16.4**

![](http://i.imgur.com/mSKv57I.png)

It looks like a default button. You can remove the border around the button by adding the `icon-only` css class to it. Optionally
you can configure an icon for the graphic node if you like. The built in icons are svg shapes added in the built in `workspace.css`
but feel free to add your icon in any way you see fit. Let's add an icon from the FontAwesomeFX library and make it look like
the other buttons:

```kotlin
button("Add Customer") {
    addClass("icon-only")
    graphic = FontAwesomeIconView(PLUS_CIRCLE).apply {
        style {
            fill = c("#818181")
        }
        glyphSize = 18
    }
    setOnAction { addCustomer() }
}
```

In a real application you would use a css class so you don't need to configure the fill for every button you add. The result can be seen in Figure 16.5:

## Navigating between docked views

Our Customer List is configured so that whenever you double click a customer you will be taken to an editor for that customer.
The TableView binds the selected user to a `CustomerModel` view model object, and the action is performed like this:

```kotlin
tableview(customers) {
    column("First Name", Customer::firstNameProperty)
    column("Last Name", Customer::lastNameProperty)
    bindSelected(model)
    onUserSelect { workspace.dock<CustomerEditor>() }
}
```

The only thing we need to do is actually dock the `CustomerEditor` when the user selects a row. Since the `CustomerEditor`
will be looked up in the same scope we are currently in, it will have access to the selected customer as well:

```kotlin
class CustomerEditor : Fragment("Customer Editor") {
    val customer: CustomerModel by inject()
    override val savable = customer.dirty
    override val headingProperty = customer.fullName

    override val root = form {
        fieldset("Customer Details") {
            field("First Name") {
                textfield(customer.firstName)
            }
            field("Last Name") {
                textfield(customer.lastName)
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onSave() {
        customer.commit()
    }

    override fun onRefresh() {
        customer.rollback()
    }
}
```

The customer model is injected, and will contain the selected customer from the list. The `savable` property is bound
to the `dirty` property of the model and the `headingProperty` is bound to a `StringBinding` called `fullName`, which
concatinates the first and last names and updates whenever they are changed. The form fields bind to the name properties
and lastly the `onSave` and `onRefresh` functions are implemented to react to the corresponding Workspace buttons.

**Figure 16.6**

![](http://i.imgur.com/ZPomPti.png)

We can see that the `title` and `heading` are indeed displaying separate information. Since we haven't made any edits
yet, the **Save** button is disabled, while the **Refresh** button is available, and would roll back any changes made
since the last commit.

The `back` button is enabled as well, and clicking it would navigate back to the Customer list. This is a very powerful
feature which enables browser like navigation in your application with very little effort on your part. The Workspace
keeps a navigation stack of configurable depth. By default it will contain 10 previously docked views. You can configure the
`maxViewStackDepth` to change the number of views held in the navigation stack.

## Advanced scope navigation

When you leverage injected view models together with a navigation stack, some interesting challenges appear that need
to be addressed. If you removed the **Back** button (`workspace.backButton.removeFromParent()`) or set the `maxViewStackDepth` to
`0` you can disregard this particular challenge, but to leverage this powerful navigation paradigm, there are some things
you need to think about.
 
Consider our prevous example with an injected `CustomerModel` that represents the currently selected customer in the `CustomerList`
while also being used by the `CustomerEditor` to edit that same customer. Then let's assume that there is a way to search for
a customer and edit it, perhaps using a `TextField` in the ToolBar of the Workspace as a search entry point. If you search for
a new customer and go on to edit it, then navigate back to the previous customer editor, it would suddenly operate on the 
last customer you set in the `CustomerModel`. You can probably imagine the ensuing havoc.

Fortunately, the scoping support stretches far into the Workspace feature and provides some handy tools for this particular situation.

We need to find a way to contain the scope for the pair of CustomerList and CustomerEditor so they can work together while allowing
other views to use the `CustomerModel`, but in a different scope. It's actually quite easy. Whenever you create a new `CustomerList`,
also create a new Scope. If you were to do this manually, it would look something like this:


```kotlin
// Create a new scope, but keep the current workspace
val newScope = Scope(workspace)

// Find the CustomerList in the new scope
val customerList = find<CustomerList>(newScope)

// Dock the customerList in the workspace
workspace.dock(customerList)
```

Those three distinct operations can be performed in a single call:

```kotlin
workspace.dockInNewScope<CustomerList>()
```

When the CustomerList docks the CustomerEditor later on, it happens in this new scope. But what about the search field?

We would need to provide a separate scope for the `CustomerEditor` that should show the result of the search, but
were we would also also need to inject the customer model containing the selected customer into the new scope. This
following code is imagined inside the action that selects a customer from the search result:
 
```kotlin
fun editCustomer(customer: Customer) {
// Create a view model for the customer
val model = CustomerModel(customer)

// Create a new scope, but keep the current workspace
val newScope = Scope(workspace)

// Insert the customer model into the new scope
newScope.set(model)

// Find the CustomerEditor in the new scope
val editor = find<CustomerEditor>(newScope)

// Dock the editor
workspace.dock(editor)
}
```

That's a lot of steps. Fortunately, we can do that as well in a single call:

```kotlin
fun editCustomer(customer: Customer) {
    workspace.dockInNewScope<CustomerEditor>(CustomerModel(customer))
}
```

The `dockInNewScope` function takes a vararg list of injectable objects to insert into the new scope before looking
up our CustomerEditor and docking it.

Separating scopes this way makes sure we can utilize injected view models without being afraid of other views stepping
on our data. It is a pragmatic approach to an intricate problem. It also gives you a way of bleeding injectables
into new scopes, should your use case require it.
