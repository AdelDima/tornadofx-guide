# Workspaces

Java Business applications have traditionally been based on one of the the Rich Client Frameworks,
namely NetBeans Platform or Eclipse RCP. An important reason for choosing an RCP platform has been the
workspace like functionality they provide. Some important features of a workspace are:

- Common action buttons that tie to the state of the docked view (Save, Refresh etc)
- Context based UI nodes added to the common workspace interface
- Navigation stack for traversing visited views, controlled through back and forward buttons like a web browser
- Menu system with dynamic contributions and modifications

TornadoFX has begun to bridge the gap between the RCP platforms by providing Workspaces. While still in it's infancy,
the default functionality is a solid foundation for business applications in need of the features discussed above.

## The simplest possible Workspace app

To kick off a Workspace app, all you need to do is to subclass `App` and set the primary `View` to `Workspace::class`.
The result can be seen below (Figure 16.1).

```kotlin
class MyApp : App(Workspace::class)
```

**Figure 16.1**

The resulting Workspace consists of a button bar with four default buttons and an empty content area below it.
The content area can house any `UIComponent`. You add a component to the `content` area by calling `workspace.dock()` on it.
Let's pretend we have a `CustomerList` component that we would like to dock in the Workspace as the application starts.
We do this by overriding the `onBeforeShow` callback:


```kotlin
class MyApp : App(Workspace::class) {
    override fun onBeforeShow(view: UIComponent) {
        workspace.dock<CustomerList>()
    }
}
```

**Figure 16.2**

The complete code of the Customer List is not important for us, suffice it to say that it displays a TableView and
lists some Customers. What is interesting however, is that the **Refresh** button in the Workspace was enabled
when the `CustomerList` was docked, while the **Save** button remained disabled.

### Leveraging the Workspace buttons

Whenever a `UIComponent` is docked in the Workspace, the **Refresh** and **Save** buttons will enable by default. This happens
because the Workspace looks at the `refreshable` and `savable` properties in the docked component. Every `UIComponent` 
returns a boolean property with the default value of `true`, which the Workspace then connects to the enabled state of
these buttons. In the `CustomerList` example, we made sure the **Save** button was always disabled by overriding this property:

```
override val savable = SimpleBooleanProperty(false)
```

We didn't touch the `refreshable` property, so it remains `true` as per the default. Whenever the `Refresh` button
is called, it will fire the `onRefresh` function in the `View`. You can override this to provide your refresh action:

```
override val onRefresh() {
    customerTable.asyncItems { customerController.listCustomers() }
}
```

We will revisit the **Save** button and introduce a neat trick to only activate it when there are dirty changes later in this chapter.

### Modifying the default workspace

The default workspace only gives you basic functionality. As your application grows you will want to suplement the
 toolbar with more buttons and controls, and maybe a `MenuBar` above it. For small modifications you can augment
 it in the `onBeforeFunction` as we did above, but you will most probably want to subclass as the customizations
 become more advanced. The following code and image is taken from a real world CRM application:
 
```kotlin
class CRMWorkspace : Workspace() {
    init {
        add(MainMenu::class)
        add(RestProgressBar::class)
        add(SearchView::class)
    }
}
```

The `CRMWorkspace` loads three other views into it. One providing a `MenuBar`, then the default `RestProgressBar` is
added, and lastly a `SearchView` providing a search input field is added. 

The Workspace has a pretty good idea about where to place whatever you add to it. For example, buttons will by default
be added after the four default buttons, while other components are added to the far right of the ToolBar. The MenuBar
is automatically added above the ToolBar, at the top of the screen.

Figure 16.3 shows how it looks in production, with a little bit of custom styling and a `CustomerEditor` docked into it.
This application happens to be in Norwegian, and some of the information in the Customer card has been removed.

**Figure 16.3**

You will notice that the **Save** button is enabled in this View. We have bound the `savable` state property to
the dirty state property of the view model:

```kotlin
val model: CustomerModel by inject()
override val savable = model.dirty
```

When a customer is loaded, the **Save** button will stay disabled until an edit has been made. To save, we override the `onSave` function:

```kotlin
override fun onSave() {
    runAsync {
        customerController.save(customer.item)
    } ui { saved ->
        customer.update(saved)    
    }
}
```

The `customerController.save` call will return the `Customer` from the server once it is saved. If the server made any changes
to our customer object, they would have been reflected in the saved customer we got back. For that reason, we call
`customer.update(saved)` which is function you get for free if you implement `JsonModel`. This makes sure that changes
from the server is pushed back into the model. This is completely optional, and you might just want to do `customerController.save(customer.item)`.
