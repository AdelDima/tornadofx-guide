#Builders Part III - Type-Safe CSS

While you can create static CSS style sheets in JavaFX, TornadoFX provides the option to bring type-safety and compiled CSS to JavaFX. You can conveniently choose to create styles in its own class, or do it inline conveniently within a control declaration. 

### Inline CSS

The quickest and easiest way to style a control on the fly is to call a given `Node`'s inline `style { }` function. All the CSS properties available on a given control are available in a type-safe manner, with compilation checks and autocompletion. 

For example, you can style the borders (using the `box()` function) on a `Button`, bold its font, and rotate it (Figure 6.1). 

```kotlin
button("Press Me") {
	style {
		fontWeight = FontWeight.EXTRA_BOLD
		borderColor = box(
				top = Color.RED,
				right = Color.DARKGREEN,
				left = Color.ORANGE,
				bottom = Color.PURPLE
		)
		rotate = AngularDimension(45.0, AngularDimension.Units.deg)
	}
    
    setOnAction { println("You pressed the button") }
}
```

This is especially helpful when you want to style a control without breaking the declaration flow of the `Button`. However, keep in mind the `style { }` will replace all styles applied to that control. When you start dealing with more dynamic and conditional stylings, you may want to create a type-safe style sheet which we will cover next. 

### Applying Style Classes with Stylesheets

If you want to organize, re-use, and override styles you need to leverage a `Stylesheet`. Traditionally in JavaFX, a stylesheet is defined in a static CSS text file included in the project. However, TornadoFX allows creating stylesheets with pure Kotlin code. This has the benefits of compilation checks, auto-completion, and other perks that come with statically typed code in an IDE.

To declare a `Stylesheet`, extend it onto your own class to hold your customized styles. 

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class MyStyle: Stylesheet() {
}
```

Next, you will want to give ita `companion object` to hold class-level properties that can easily be retrieved. Declare a new `cssclass()`-delegated property called `tackyButton`, and define four colors we will use for its borders. 

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.paint.Color
import tornadofx.*

class MyStyle: Stylesheet() {

    companion object {
        val tackyButton by cssclass()

        private val topColor = Color.RED
        private val rightColor = Color.DARKGREEN
        private val leftColor = Color.ORANGE
        private val bottomColor = Color.PURPLE
    }
}
```

Finally, declare an `init()` block. Call the `s()` selector function and provide a block that manipulates its various properties. Set `rotate` to 10 degrees, define the `borderColor` using the four colors and the `box()` function, make the font family "Comic Sans MS", and increase the `fontSize` to 20 pixels using the `LinearDimension` object. 

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.paint.Color
import tornadofx.*

class MyStyle: Stylesheet() {

    companion object {
        val tackyButton by cssclass()

        private val topColor = Color.RED
        private val rightColor = Color.DARKGREEN
        private val leftColor = Color.ORANGE
        private val bottomColor = Color.PURPLE
    }

    init {
        s(tackyButton) {
            rotate = AngularDimension(10.0, AngularDimension.Units.deg)
            borderColor = box(topColor,rightColor,leftColor,bottomColor)
            fontFamily = arrayOf("Comic Sans MS")
            fontSize = LinearDimension(20.0, LinearDimension.Units.px)
        }
    }
}
```

Now you can apply the `tackyButton` style to buttons, labels, and other controls that support these properties. While this styling can work with other controls like labels, we are going to target buttons specifically. 

To use the styles, you can apply the style directly to a control by calling its `addClass()` function and providing the `MyStyle.tackyButton` style to it (Figure 6.2). 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root = BorderPane()

    init {
        with(root) {
            center {
                button("Press Me") {
                    addClass(MyStyle.tackyButton)
                }
                button("Press Me Too") {
                    addClass(MyStyle.tackyButton)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
