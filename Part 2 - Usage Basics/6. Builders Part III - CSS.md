#Builders Part III - Type-Safe CSS

While you can create static CSS style sheets in JavaFX, TornadoFX provides the option to bring type-safety and compiled CSS to JavaFX. You can conveniently choose to create styles in its own class, or do it inline conveniently within a control declaration. 

### Inline CSS

The quickest and easiest way to style a control on the fly is to call a given `Node`'s inline `style { }` function. All the CSS properties available on a given control are available in a type-safe manner, with compilation checks and autocompletion. 

For example, you can style the borders on a `Button`, bold its font, and rotate it (Figure 6.1). 

```kotlin
button("Press Me") {
	style {
		fontWeight = FontWeight.EXTRA_BOLD
		borderColor = CssBox(
				top = Color.RED,
				right = Color.DARKGREEN,
				left = Color.ORANGE,
				bottom = Color.PURPLE
		)
		rotate = AngularDimension(45.0, AngularDimension.Units.deg)
	}
}
```

This is especially helpful when you want to style a control without creating a `String` or stylesheet separately from the control
