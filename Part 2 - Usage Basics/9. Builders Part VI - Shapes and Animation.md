# Builders Part VI - Shapes and Animation

JavaFX comes with nodes that represent almost any geometric shape as well as a `Path` node that
provides facilities required for assembly and management of a geometric path.

TornadoFX comes with builders to streamline the declaration of shapes using functional constructs.

## Common structure

Every parameter to the shape builders are optional, and in most cases default to a value of `0.0`.
This means that you only need to provide the parameters you care about. The builders have positional parameters
for most of the properties of each shape, and the rest can be set in the functional block that follows. Therefore,
these are all valid ways to create a rectangle:

```kotlin
rectangle {
	width = 100.0
	height = 100.0
}

rectangle(width = 100.0, height = 100.0)

rectangle(0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 100.0)
```

The form you choose is a matter of preference, but you should consider the legibility of the code you write. The examples in this
chapter specify all properties inside the code block for clarity.
 
## Position within the parent

Most of the shape builders gives you the option to specify the location of the shape within the parent. 
Whether or not this will have any effect depends on the parent node. An `HBox` will not care about the `x` and `y` 
coordinates you specify, but a `Group` will. The screenshots below were created by wrapping a `StackPane` with padding around
a `Group`, and finally the shape was created inside that `Group`.

## Rectangle

Rectangle defines a rectangle with optional size and location in the parent. Rounded corners can be specified with the `arcWidth` and `arcHeight` properties.

```kotlin
rectangle {
	fill = Color.BLUE
	width = 300.0
	height = 150.0
	arcWidth = 20.0
	arcHeight = 20.0
}
```

## Arc

Arc represents a arc object defined by a center, start angle, angular extent (length of the arc in degrees), and an arc type 
(OPEN, CHORD, or ROUND).

```kotlin
arc {
    centerX = 200.0
    centerY = 200.0
    radiusX = 50.0
    radiusY = 50.0
    startAngle = 45.0
    length = 250.0
    type = ArcType.ROUND
}
```
