#Builders Part II - Data Controls

Any significant application works with data, and providing a means for users to view, manipulate, and modify data is not a trivial task for user interface development. Fortunately, TornadoFX streamlines many JavaFX data controls such as `ListView`, `TableView`, `TreeView`, and `TreeTableView`. These controls can be cumbersome to set up in a purely object-oriented way. But using builders through functional declarations, we can code all these controls in a much more declarative way. 

###ListView
A `ListView` is similar to a `ComboBox` but it displays all items within a `ScrollView` and has the option of allowing multiple selections, as shown in Figure 2.3.1.

```kotlin
listview<String> {
    items.add("Alpha")
    items.add("Beta")
    items.add("Gamma")
    items.add("Delta")
    items.add("Epsilon")
    selectionModel.selectionMode = SelectionMode.MULTIPLE
}
```

You can also provide it an `ObservableList` of items up front and omit the type declaration since it can be inferred.

```kotlin
val greekLetters = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha","Beta",
        "Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")

listview(greekLetters) {
    selectionModel.selectionMode = SelectionMode.MULTIPLE
}
```

Like most data controls, keep in mind that by default, the `ListView` will call `toString()` to render the text for each item in your domain class.  

###TableView

Probably one of the most significant builders in TornadoFX is the one for `TableView`. If you have worked with JavaFX, you might have experienced building a `TableView` in an object-oriented way. But TornadoFX provides a functional declaration construct pattern using extension functions that greatly simplifies the coding of a `TableView`. 

Say you have a domain type, such as `Person`. 

```kotlin
class Person(val id: Int, val name: String, val birthday: LocalDate) {
    val age: Int get() = Period.between(birthday, LocalDate.now()).years
}
```

Take several instances of `Person` and put them in an `ObservableList`. 

```kotlin
private val persons = FXCollections.observableArrayList<Person>(
        Person(1,"Samantha Stuart",LocalDate.of(1981,12,4)),
        Person(2,"Tom Marks",LocalDate.of(2001,1,23)),
        Person(3,"Stuart Gills",LocalDate.of(1989,5,23)),
        Person(3,"Nicole Williams",LocalDate.of(1998,8,11))
)
```

You can quickly declare a `TableView` with all of its columns using a functional construct, and specify the `items` property to an `ObservableList<Person>`.

```kotlin
tableview<Person> {
    items = persons
    column("ID",Person::id)
    column("Name", Person::name)
    column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
    column("Age",Person::age)
}
```

######Figure 2.3.2 - A TableView with four columns


The `column()` functions are extension functions for `TableView` accepting a `title` and a mapped property using reflection syntax. 

####Using "Property" properties

If you follow the JavaFX `Property` conventions to set up your domain class, it will automatically support value editing. 

You can create these `Property` objects the conventional way, or you can use TornadoFX's `property` delegates to automatically create these `Property` declarations as shown below. 

```kotlin
class Person(id: Int, name: String, birthday: LocalDate) {
    var id by property(id)
    fun idProperty() = getProperty(Person::id)

    var name by property(name)
    fun nameProperty() = getProperty(Person::name)

    var birthday by property(birthday)
    fun birthdayProperty() = getProperty(Person::birthday)

    val age: Int get() = Period.between(birthday, LocalDate.now()).years
}
```

You need to create `xxxProperty()` functions for each property to support JavaFX's naming convention when it uses reflection. This can easily be done by relaying their calls to `getProperty()` to retrieve the `Property` for a given field. See Chapter X for detailed information on how these property delegates work. 

####Using cellFormat()

There are other extension functions applied to `TableView` that can assist the flow of declaring a `TableView`. For instance, you can call a `cellFormat()` function on a given column to apply formatting rules, such as highlighting "Age" values less than 18. 

```kotlin
tableview<Person> {
    items = persons
    column("ID",Person::id)
    column("Name", Person::name)
    column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
    column("Age",Person::age).cellFormat {
        if (it < 18) {
            style = "-fx-background-color:#8b0000; -fx-text-fill:white"
            text = it.toString()
        } else {
            text = it.toString()
        }
     }
}
```

####Declaring Column Values Functionally

If you need to map a column's value to a non-property (such as a function), you can use a non-reflection means to extract the values for that column.

Say you have a `WeeklyReport` type that has a `getTotal()` function accepting a `DayOfWeek` argument (an enum of Monday, Tuesday... Sunday).

```kotlin 
abstract class WeeklyReport(val startDate: LocalDate) {
    abstract fun getTotal(dayOfWeek: DayOfWeek): BigDecimal
}
```

Let's say you wanted to create a column for each `DayOfWeek`. You cannot map to properties, but you can map each `WeeklyReport` item explicitly to extract each value for that `DayOfWeek`. 

```kotlin
tableview<WeeklyReport> {
    for (dayOfWeek in DayOfWeek.values()) {
        column<WeeklyReport, BigDecimal>(dayOfWeek.toString()) {
            ReadOnlyObjectWrapper(it.value.getTotal(dayOfWeek))
        }
    }
}
```
>This more closely resembles the traditional `setCellValueFactory()` for the  JavaFX `TableColumn`. 

###TreeView

The `TreeView` contains elements where each element may contain child elements. Typically arrows allow you to expand a parent element to see its children. For instance, we can nest employees under department names.

######Figure 2.3.4 - A TreeView with nested elements

Traditionally in JavaFX, populating these elements is rather cumbersome and verbose. Fortunately TornadoFX makes it relatively simple. 

Say you have a simple type `Person` ana an `ObservableList` containing several instances. 

```kotlin

data class Person(val name: String, val department: String)
        
val persons = listOf(
        Person("Mary Hanes","Marketing"),
        Person("Steve Folley","Customer Service"),
        Person("John Ramsy","IT Help Desk"),
        Person("Erlick Foyes","Customer Service"),
        Person("Erin James","Marketing"),
        Person("Jacob Mays","IT Help Desk"),
        Person("Larry Cable","Customer Service")
```

Creating a `TreeView` with the `treeview()` builder can be done functionally. 

```kotlin
// Create Person objects for the departments 
// with the department name as Person.name

val departments = persons
    .map { it.department }
    .distinct().map { Person(it, "") }

treeview<Person> {
    // Create root item
    root = TreeItem(Person("Departments", ""))

    // Make sure the text in each TreeItem is the name of the Person
    cellFormat { text = it.name }

    // Generate items. Children of the root item will contain departments
    populate { parent ->
        if (parent == root) departments else persons.filter { it.department == parent.value.name }
    }
}
```

Let's break this down:

```kotlin
val departments = persons
    .map { it.department }
    .distinct().map { Person(it, "") }
```

First we gather a distinct list of all the `departments` derived from the `persons` list. But then we put each `department` String in a `Person` object since the `TreeView` only accepts `Person` elements. While this is not very intuitive, this is the constraint and design of `TreeView`. We must make each `department` a `Person` for it to be accepted.

```kotlin
treeview<Person> {
    // Create root item
    root = TreeItem(Person("Departments", ""))
```

Next we specify the highest `root` for the `TreeView` that all departments will be nested under, and we give it a placeholder `Person` called "Departments".

```kotlin
    cellFormat { text = it.name }
```

Then we specify the `cellFormat()` to render the `name` of each `Person` (including departments) on each cell. 

```kotlin
   populate { parent ->
        if (parent == root) departments else persons.filter { it.department == parent.value.name }
    }
```

Finally, we call the `populate()` function and provide a block instructing how to provide children to each `parent`. If the `parent` is indeed the `root`, then we return the `departments`. Otherwise the `parent` is a `department` and we provide a list of `Person` objects belonging to that `department.

####TreeView with Differing Types

It is not necessarily intuitive to make every entity in the previous example a `Person`. We made each department a `Person` as well as the `root` "Departments". For a more complex `TreeView<T>` where `T` is unknown and can be any number of types, it is better to leverage [star projection](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/generics.html#star-projections) for type `T`. 

Using star projection, you can safely populate multiple types nested into the `TreeView`. 

For instance, you can create a `Department` type and leverage `cellFormat()` to utilize type-checking for rendering. Then you can use a `populate()` function that will iterate over each element, and you specify the children for each element (if any).

```kotlin
data class Department(val name: String)

// Create Department objects for the departments by getting distinct values from Person.department
val departments = persons.map { it.department }.distinct().map { Department(it) }

// Type safe way of extracting the correct TreeItem text
cellFormat {
    text = when (it) {
        is String -> it
        is Department -> it.name
        is Person -> it.name
        else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid value type")
    }
}

// Generate items. Children of the root item will contain departments, children of departments are filtered
populate { parent ->
    val value = parent.value
    if (parent == root) departments
    else if (value is Department) persons.filter { it.department == value.name }
    else null
}
```

###TreeTableView

The `TreeTableView` operates and functions similarly to a `TreeView`, but it has multiple columns since it is a table. 

Say you have a `Person` class that optionally has an `employees` parameter, which defaults to an empty `List<Person>` if nobody reports to that `Person`. 



```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, val department: String, val email: String, val employees: List<Person> = emptyList())

```

Then you have an `ObservableList<Person>` holding instances of this class.

```kotlin
val persons = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
        Person("Mary Hanes", "IT Administration", "mary.hanes@contoso.com", listOf(
            Person("Jacob Mays", "IT Help Desk", "jacob.mays@contoso.com"),
            Person("John Ramsy", "IT Help Desk", "john.ramsy@contoso.com"))),
        Person("Erin James", "Human Resources", "erin.james@contoso.com", listOf(
            Person("Erlick Foyes", "Customer Service", "erlick.foyes@contoso.com"),
            Person("Steve Folley", "Customer Service", "steve.folley@contoso.com"),
            Person("Larry Cable", "Customer Service", "larry.cable@contoso.com")))
)
```

You can create a `TreeTableView` by merging the declarations needed for a `TableView` and `TreeView` together. You will need to call the `populate()` function needs to be provided as well as the root `TreeItem`. 

```kotlin
val treeTableView = TreeTableView<Person>().apply {
    column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
    column("Department", Person::departmentProperty)
    column("Email", Person::emailProperty)

    /// Create the root item that holds all top level employees
    root = TreeItem(Person("Employees by leader", "", "", persons))

    // Always return employees under the current person
    populate { it.value.employees }

    // Expand the two first levels
    root.isExpanded = true
    root.children.forEach { it.isExpanded = true }

    // Resize to display all elements on the first two levels
    resizeColumnsToFitContent()
}
```

###Summary

Functional constructs work well with data controls like `TableView`, `TreeView`, and others we have seen in this chapter. Using the builder patterns, you can quickly and functionally declare how data is displayed. 

In the next chapter, we will embed controls in layouts to create more complex UI's easily.
