#Builders Part I - Basic Controls

One of the most exciting features of TornadoFX are the Type-Safe Builders. Configuring and laying out controls for complex UI's can be verbose and difficult, and the code can quickly become messy to maintain. Fortunately, you can use a [powerful closure pattern](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html) pioneered by Groovy to create structured UI layouts with pure and simple Kotlin code.

While we will learn how to apply FXML later, you may find builders to be an expressive, robust way to create complex UI's in a fraction of the time. 

##How Builders Work
Kotlin's standard library comes with a handful of helpful "block" functions to target items of any type `T`. You have already seen the [with() function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/with.html), which allows you to write code against an item as if you were right inside of its class. 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `with()` function accepts the `root` as an argument. The  following closure argument manipulates `root` directly by referring to it as `this`, which was safely interpreted as a `VBox`. A `Button` was added to the `VBox` by calling it's `plusAssign()` extended operator. 

Alternatively, every type in Kotlin has an [apply() function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/apply.html). This is almost the same functionality as `with()`, but it is actually an extended higher-order function.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        root.apply { 
            this += Button("Press Me")
        }
    }
}
```

Both `with()` and `apply()` accomplish a similar task. They safely interpret the type they are targeting and allow manipulations to be done to it. However, `with()` returns `Unit` so it does not return any meaningful value, whereas `apply()` does in fact return the item it was targeting. Therefore, if you call `apply()` on a `Button` to manipulate  say, its font color and action, it is helpful the `Button` returns itself so as to not break the declaration flow. 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me").apply {
                textFill = Color.RED
                setOnAction { println("Button pressed!") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The basic concepts of how builders work are expressed above. There are three tasks being done: 

1. A `Button` is created
2. The `Button` is modified
3. The `Button` is added to its "parent", which is a `VBox`

When declaring any `Node`, these three steps are so common that TornadoFX streamlines them for you using strategically placed extension functions.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            button("Press Me") {
                textFill = Color.RED
                setOnAction { println("Button pressed!") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You might be wondering: "How did we just get rid of the `this +=` and `apply()` function call? And why are we using a function called `button()` instead of an actual `Button`?"  

We will not go too deep on how this is done, and you can always dig into the source code if you are curious. But essentially, the `VBox` as well as any `Pane` has an extension function called `button()`. It accepts a text argument and an optional closure targeting a `Button` it will instantiate. When this function is called, it will create a `Button` with the specified text, apply the closure to it, add it to the `Pane` it was  called on, and then return it. 

This pattern becomes especially powerful when you start nesting controls into other controls. Using these builder extension functions, you can easily populate and nest multiple `HBox` instances into a `VBox`, and create UI code that is clearly structured.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            hbox {
                label("First Name")
                textfield()
            }
            hbox {
                label("Last Name")
                textfield()
            }
            button("LOGIN") {
                useMaxWidth = true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**RENDERED UI:**

If you need to save references to controls such as the TextFields, you can save them to variables or properties since the functions return the produced nodes. It is recommend you use the `singleAssign()` delegates to ensure the properties are only assigned once. 

```kotlin

class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()
    var firstNameField: TextField by singleAssign()
    var lastNameField: TextField by singleAssign()

    init {
        with(root) {
            hbox {
                label("First Name")
                firstNameField = textfield()
            }
            hbox {
                label("Last Name")
                lastNameField = textfield()
            }
            button("LOGIN") {
                useMaxWidth = true
                setOnAction {
                    println("Logging in as ${firstNameField.text} ${lastNameField.text}")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that non-builder extension functions and properties have been added to Nodes as well. The `useMaxWidth` is an extended property for `Node`, and it sets the `Node` to occupied the maximum width allowed. We will see more of these helpful extensions throughout the next few chapters, and you can view a comprehensive list of these extensions Appendix X. 

##Builders for Basic Controls
