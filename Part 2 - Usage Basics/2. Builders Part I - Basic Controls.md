#Builders Part I - Basic Controls

One of the most exciting features of TornadoFX is the Type-Safe Builders. Configuring and laying out controls for complex UI's can be verbose and difficult. UI code can quickly become messy and difficult to adapt and maintain. Fortunately, you can use a [powerful closure pattern](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html) pioneered by Groovy to create powerful UI layouts with simple and structured pure Kotlin code.

While we will learn to leverage FXML later, you may find builders to be an expressive, robust way to create complex UI's in a fraction of the time. 

##How Builders Work
Kotlin's standard library comes with a handful of helpful "block" functions to target any `T` item of any type. You have already seen the [with() function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/with.html), which allows you to write code against an item as if you were right inside of its class. 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `with()` function accepted the `root` as an argument. The  following closure argument manipulates `root` directly by referring to it as `this`. A `Button` was added to the `root`, which was safely interpreted as a `VBox` and therefore can call it's `plusAssign()` extended operator. 

Alternatively, every type in Kotlin has an [apply() function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/apply.html). This is almost the same functionality as `with()`, but it is actually an extended member for all types.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        root.apply { 
            this += Button("Press Me")
        }
    }
}
```

Both `with()` and `apply()` accomplish a similar task. They safely interpret the type they are targeting and allow manipulations to be done to it. However, `with()` returns `Unit` so it does not return any meaningful value, whereas `apply()` does in fact return the value it was targeting. Therefore, if you call `apply()` on a `Button` to manipulate, say, its font color and action, it is helpful the `Button` returns itself so as to not break the flow.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me").apply {
                textFill = Color.RED
                setOnAction { println("Button pressed!") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There are three tasks being done above: 
1. A `Button` is created
2. The `Button` is modified
3. The `Button` is added to its "parent", which is a `VBox`

For any `Node`, these three steps are so common that TornadoFX streamlines them for you using strategically placed extension functions you can call.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            button("Press Me") {
                textFill = Color.RED
                setOnAction { println("Button pressed!") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Whoa! How did we just get rid of the `this +=` and `apply()` function call? And why are we using a function called `button()` instead of an actual `Button`? 

We will no go too deep on how this is done, and you can always dig into the source code if you want to. Essentially, the `VBox` as well as any `Pane` has an extension function called `button()`. It accepts a text argument and an optional closure targeting a `Button`. When this function is called, it will create a `Button` with the specified text, apply the closure to it, add it to the `Pane` the `button()` function was called on, and then return it. 

This pattern becomes especially powerful when you start nesting controls into other controls. Using the extension functions to add Nodes, you can easily populate and nest HBoxes into a VBox, and create UI code that is clearly maintainable and structured.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            hbox {
                label("First Name")
                textfield()
            }
            hbox {
                label("Last Name")
                textfield()
            }
            button("LOGIN") {
                useMaxWidth = true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you need to save references to controls, such as the TextFields, you can save them to variables or properties since the functions return the produced Nodes. It is recommend you use the `singleAssign()` delegates so the properties are only assigned once. 

```kotlin

class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()
    var firstNameField: TextField by singleAssign()
    var lastNameField: TextField by singleAssign()

    init {
        with(root) {
            hbox {
                label("First Name")
                firstNameField = textfield()
            }
            hbox {
                label("Last Name")
                lastNameField = textfield()
            }
            button("LOGIN") {
                useMaxWidth = true
                setOnAction {
                    println("Logging in as ${firstNameField.text} ${lastNameField.text}")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
