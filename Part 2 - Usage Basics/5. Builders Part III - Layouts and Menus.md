#Builders Part III - Layouts and Menus

Complex UI's require many controls. It is likely these controls need to be grouped, positioned, and sized with set policies. Fortunately TornadoFX streamlines many layouts that come with JavaFX as well as its own proprietary Form Builder layout. 

TornadoFX also has type-safe builders to create menus in a highly structured, declarative way. Menus can be especially cumbersome to build using conventional JavaFX code, and Kotlin really shines in this department. 

##Builders for Layouts

Layouts group controls and set policies about their sizing and positioning behavior. Technically, layouts themselves are controls so therefore you can nest layouts inside layouts. This is critical for building complex UI's, and TornadoFX makes maintenance of UI code easier by visibly showing the nested relationships between different controls. 

###VBox

A `VBox` stacks controls vertically in the order they are declared inside its block (Figure 5.1). 

```kotlin
vbox {
	button("Button 1").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 1 Pressed")
	}
	button("Button 2").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 2 Pressed")
	}
}
```

You can also call `vboxconstraints()` within the VBox's block to change the margin and vertical growing behaviors of the `VBox`. 


```kotlin
vbox {
    vboxConstraints {
        marginRight = 20.0
        vGrow = Priority.ALWAYS
    }
    button("Button 1")
    button("Button 2")
}
```

###HBox

HBox is identical to the VBox in terms of functionality, but it stacks all controls horizontally left-to-right in the order declared in its block. 


```kotlin
hbox {
	button("Button 1").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 1 Pressed")
	}
	button("Button 2").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 2 Pressed")
	}
}
```

You can also call `hboxconstraints()` within the HBox's block to change the margin and horizontal growing behaviors of the `HBox`. 


```kotlin
hbox {
    hboxConstraints {
        marginRight = 20.0
        hGrow = Priority.ALWAYS
    }
    button("Button 1")
    button("Button 2")
}
```

###FlowPane

The `FlowPane` lays out controls left-to-right and wraps to the next line on the boundary. For example, say you added 100 buttons to a `FlowPane` (Figure 2.5.1). You will notice it simply lays out buttons from left-to-right, and when it runs out of room it moves to the "next line". 

```kotlin
flowpane {
   for (i in 1..100) {
        button(i.toString()) {
            setOnAction { println("You pressed button $i") }
        }
   }
}
```

Notice also when you resize the window, the `FlowLayout` will re-wrap the buttons so they all can fit (Figure 2.5.2)

The `FlowLayout` is not used very often because it is pretty simplistic, but it comes in handy for certain situations and can be used inside other layouts. 

###BorderPane

The `BorderPane` is a useful layout that divides controls into 5 regions: `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`, and `center`. Many UI's can easily be laid using two or more of these regions to hold controls (Figure 2.5.3). 

```kotlin
borderpane {
    top {
        label("TOP") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style += "-fx-background-color: RED"
        }
    }
    bottom {
        label("BOTTOM") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style += "-fx-background-color: BLUE"
        }
    }
    left {
        label("LEFT") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style += "-fx-background-color: GREEN"
        }
    }
    right {
        label("RIGHT") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style += "-fx-background-color: PURPLE"
        }
    }
    center {
        label("CENTER") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style += "-fx-background-color: YELLOW"
        }
    }
}
```

You will notice that the `top` and `bottom` regions take up the entire horizontal space, while `left`, `center`, and `right` must share the available horizontal space. But `center` is entitled to any extra available space, making it idea l to hold large controls like `TableView`. For example, you may vertically stack some buttons in the `left` region and put a `TableView` in the `center` region (Figure 2.5.4).

```kotlin
borderpane {
    left {
        vbox {
            button("REFRESH")
            button("COMMIT")
        }
    }
    center {
        tableview<Person> {
            items = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
                    Person("Joe Thompson", 33),
                    Person("Sam Smith", 29),
                    Person("Nancy Reams", 41)
            )
    
            column("NAME",Person::name)
            column("AGE",Person::age)
        }
    }
}
```
