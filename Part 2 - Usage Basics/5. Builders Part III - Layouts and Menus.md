#Builders Part III - Layouts and Menus

Complex UI's require many controls. It is likely these controls need to be grouped, positioned, and sized with set policies. Fortunately TornadoFX streamlines many layouts that come with JavaFX as well as its own proprietary Form Builder layout. 

TornadoFX also has type-safe builders to create menus in a highly structured, declarative way. Menus can be especially cumbersome to build using conventional JavaFX code, and Kotlin really shines in this department. 

##Builders for Layouts

Layouts group controls and set policies about their sizing and positioning behavior. Technically, layouts themselves are controls so therefore you can nest layouts inside layouts. This is critical for building complex UI's, and TornadoFX makes maintenance of UI code easier by visibly showing the nested relationships between different controls. 

###VBox

A `VBox` stacks controls vertically in the order they are declared inside its block (Figure 5.1). 

```kotlin
vbox {
	button("Button 1").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 1 Pressed")
	}
	button("Button 2").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 2 Pressed")
	}
}
```

You can also call `vboxconstraints()` within the VBox's block to change the margin and vertical growing behaviors of the `VBox`. 


```kotlin
vbox {
    vboxConstraints {
        marginRight = 20.0
        vGrow = Priority.ALWAYS
    }
    button("Button 1")
    button("Button 2")
}
```

###HBox

HBox is identical to the VBox in terms of functionality, but it stacks all controls horizontally left-to-right in the order declared in its block. 


```kotlin
hbox {
	button("Button 1").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 1 Pressed")
	}
	button("Button 2").setOnAction {
	    println("Button 2 Pressed")
	}
}
```

**Figure 5.2**

You can also call `hboxconstraints()` within the HBox's block to change the margin and horizontal growing behaviors of the `HBox`. 


```kotlin
hbox {
    hboxConstraints {
        marginRight = 20.0
        hGrow = Priority.ALWAYS
    }
    button("Button 1")
    button("Button 2")
}
```

###FlowPane

The `FlowPane` lays out controls left-to-right and wraps to the next line on the boundary. For example, say you added 100 buttons to a `FlowPane` (Figure 2.5.1). You will notice it simply lays out buttons from left-to-right, and when it runs out of room it moves to the "next line". 

```kotlin
flowpane {
   for (i in 1..100) {
        button(i.toString()) {
            setOnAction { println("You pressed button $i") }
        }
   }
}
```

**Figure 2.5.1**

Notice also when you resize the window, the `FlowLayout` will re-wrap the buttons so they all can fit (Figure 2.5.2)

**Figure 2.5.2**

The `FlowLayout` is not used very often because it is pretty simplistic, but it comes in handy for certain situations and can be used inside other layouts. 

###BorderPane

The `BorderPane` is a useful layout that divides controls into 5 regions: `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`, and `center`. Many UI's can easily be built using two or more of these regions to hold controls (Figure 2.5.3). 

```kotlin
borderpane {
    top {
        label("TOP") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style {
                backgroundColor = Color.RED
            }
        }
    }
    bottom {
        label("BOTTOM") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style {
                backgroundColor = Color.BLUE
            }
        }
    }
    left {
        label("LEFT") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style {
                backgroundColor = Color.GREEN
            }
        }
    }
    right {
        label("RIGHT") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style {
                backgroundColor = Color.PURPLE
            }
        }
    }
    center {
        label("CENTER") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            style {
                backgroundColor = Color.YELLOW
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You will notice that the `top` and `bottom` regions take up the entire horizontal space, while `left`, `center`, and `right` must share the available horizontal space. But `center` is entitled to any extra available space, making it idea l to hold large controls like `TableView`. For example, you may vertically stack some buttons in the `left` region and put a `TableView` in the `center` region (Figure 2.5.4).

```kotlin
borderpane {
    left {
        vbox {
            button("REFRESH")
            button("COMMIT")
        }
    }
    center {
        tableview<Person> {
            items = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
                    Person("Joe Thompson", 33),
                    Person("Sam Smith", 29),
                    Person("Nancy Reams", 41)
            )
    
            column("NAME",Person::name)
            column("AGE",Person::age)
        }
    }
}
```

`BorderPane` is a layout you will likely want to use often, as it simplifies many complex UI's. The `top` region is commonly used to hold a `MenuBar` and the `bottom` region often holds a status bar of some kind. You have already seen `center` hold the focal control such as a `TableView`, and `left` and `right` hold side panels with any peripheral controls *such as Buttons) not appropriate for the `MenuBar`. We will learn about Menus later in this section.

###Form Builder

TornadoFX has a dependency on the [Tornado Controls](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx-controls) project to make available an awesome `Form` control. Having several input fields to take user information is common and JavaFX does not have a built-in solution to streamline this. To save a lot of code, TornadoFX has a builder to declare a `Form` with any number of fields (Figure 2.5.5).

```kotlin
form {
    fieldset("Personal Info") {
        field("First Name") {
            textfield()
        }
        field("Last Name") {
            textfield()
        }
        field("Birthday") {
            datepicker()
        }
    }
    fieldset("Contact") {
        field("Phone") {
            textfield()
        }
        field("Email") {
            textfield()
        }
    }
    button("Commit") {
        setOnAction { println("Wrote to database!")}
    }
}
```

**Figure 2.5.5**

Awesome right? You can specify one or more controls for each of the fields, and the `Form` will render the groupings and labels for you.You can save each of the controls to variables or bind them to an entity, and you can leave the rendering of the control layouts to the `Form`. For this reason you will likely want to use this over the `GridPane` if possible, which we will cover next.  

###GridPane

If you want to really micromange the layout of your controls, the `GridPane` will give you plenty of that. Of course it requires more configuration and you might want to consider using `Form` or other layouts that abstract layout configuration for you. 

One way to use `GridPane` is to declare the contents of each `row`. For any given `Node` you can call its `gridpaneConstraints` to configure various `GridPane` behaviors for that `Node`, such as `margin` and `columnSpan` (Figure 2.5.6)

```kotlin
 gridpane {
     row {
         button("North") {
             useMaxWidth = true
             gridpaneConstraints {
                 marginBottom = 10.0
                 columnSpan = 2
             }
         }
     }
    row {
        button("West")
        button("East")
    }
    row {
        button("South") {
            useMaxWidth = true
            gridpaneConstraints {
                marginTop = 10.0
                columnSpan = 2
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 2.5.6**

![](http://i.imgur.com/zLo6aLF.png)

Notice how there is a margin of `10.0` between each row, which was declared for the `marginBottom` and `marginTop` of the North and South buttons respectively inside their `gridpaneConstraints`. 

Alternatively, you can explicitly specify the column/row index positions for each `Node` rather than declaring each `row` of controls. This will accomplish the exact layout we built previously, but with column/row index specifications instead. It is a bit more verbose, but it gives you more explicit control over the positions of controls. 

```kotlin
gridpane {
	 button("North") {
	     useMaxWidth = true
	     gridpaneConstraints {
	         columnRowIndex(0,0)
	         marginBottom = 10.0
	         columnSpan = 2
	     }
	 }
	button("West").gridpaneConstraints {
	    columnRowIndex(0,1)
	}
	button("East").gridpaneConstraints {
	    columnRowIndex(1,1)
	}
	
	button("South") {
	    useMaxWidth = true
	    gridpaneConstraints {
	        columnRowIndex(0,2)
	        marginTop = 10.0
	        columnSpan = 2
	    }
	}
}
```

These are all the `gridpaneConstraints` attributes you can modify on a given `Node`. Some are expressed as simple properties that can be assigned while others are assignable through functions.

|Attribute|Description|
|---|---|
|columnIndex: Int|The column index for the given control
|rowIndex: Int|The row index for the given control
|columnRowIndex(columnIndex: Int, rowIndex: Int)| Specifes the row and column index 
|columnSpan: Int| The number of columns the control occupies
|rowSpan: Int| The number of rows the control occupies
|hGrow: Priority| The horizonal grow priority
|vGrow: Priority| The vertical grow priority
|vhGrow: Priority| Specifies the same priority for `vGrow` and `hGrow`
|fillHeight: Boolean| Sets whether the `Node` fills the height of its area
|fillWidth: Boolean| Sets whether the `Node` filles the width of its area
|fillHeightWidth: Boolean| Sets whether the `Node` fills its area for both height and width
|hAlignment: HPos| The horizonal alignment policy
|vAlignment: VPos| The vertical alignment policy
|margin: Int| The margin for all four sides of the `Node`
|marginBottom: Int| The margin for the bottom side of the `Node`
|marginTop: Int| The margin for the top side of the `Node` 
|marginLeft: Int| The left margin for the left side of the `Node`
|marginRight: Int| The right margin for the right side of the `Node`
|marginLeftRight: Int| The right and left margins for the `Node`
|marginTopBottom: Int| The top and bottom marins for a `Node`


###AnchorPane

###TabPane

A `TabPane` created a UI with different screens separated by "tabs". This allows switching between different screens quickly and easily by clicking on the corresponding tab (Figure 7.1). Declare a `tabpane()` and then declare as many `tab()` instances as you need. For each `tab()` function pass in the name of the `Tab` and the parent `Node` control to populate it. 

```kotlin
 tabpane {
    tab("Screen 1", VBox()) {
        button("Button 1")
        button("Button 2")
    }
    tab("Screen 2", HBox()) {
        button("Button 3")
        button("Button 4")
    }
}
```

**Figure 7.1**

`TabePane` is an effective tool to separate screens and organize a high number of controls.The syntax is somewhat succinct enough to declare complex controls like `TableView` right inside the `tab()` block (Figure 7.2).

```kotlin
tabpane {
  tab("Screen 1", VBox()) {
      button("Button 1")
      button("Button 2")
  }
  tab("Screen 2", HBox()) {
      tableview<Person> {

          items = FXCollections.observableArrayList<Person>(
              Person(1,"Samantha Stuart",LocalDate.of(1981,12,4)),
              Person(2,"Tom Marks",LocalDate.of(2001,1,23)),
              Person(3,"Stuart Gills",LocalDate.of(1989,5,23)),
              Person(3,"Nicole Williams",LocalDate.of(1998,8,11))
          )

          column("ID",Person::id)
          column("Name", Person::name)
          column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
          column("Age",Person::age)
      }
  }
}
```

##Builders for Menus

Creating menus can be cumbersome to build in a strictly object-oriented way. But using type-safe builders, the functional constructs makes it intuitive to declare menu hierarchies. 

###MenuBar

###ContextMenu

###Menu

###MenuItem

###Separator

###RadioMenuItem

###CheckMenuItem
