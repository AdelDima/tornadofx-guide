#Builders Part V - Charts

JavaFX comes with a [handy set of charts](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/charts/chart-overview.htm) to quickly display data visualizations. While there are more comprehensive charting libraries like JFreeChart and Orson Charts, the built-in JavaFX charts satisfy a majority of visualization needs. They also have spiffy animations when they are initialized with data. TornadoFX comes with a few builders to streamline the declaration of charts using functional constructs.


##PieChart

The `PieChart` is a common visual aid to illustrate proportions of a whole. It is structurally simpler than XY charts which we will learn about later. 

But inside a `piechart()` builder you can call `data()` to pass multiple category-value pairs (Figure 8.1).

```kotlin
piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data("Windows", 77.62)
    data("OS X", 9.52)
    data("Other", 3.06)
    data("Linux", 1.55)
    data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
}
```

>Within each block of a `Chart` component, you can customize other attributes like tickmark styling as well as colors. 

**Figure 8.1**

Note you can also provide an explicit `ObservableList<PieChart.Data>` prepared in advance. The block following `piechart` can be used to modify any of the attributes of the `PieChart` just like any other control builder we covered. 

```kotlin
val items = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
        PieChart.Data("Windows", 77.62),
        PieChart.Data("OS X", 9.52),
        PieChart.Data("Other", 3.06),
        PieChart.Data("Linux", 1.55),
        PieChart.Data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
)

piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share", items) {
}
```

Or you can pass an entire collection of `items` to the `data()` function. 

```kotlin
piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data(items)
}
```

###Map-Based Data Sources

Sometimes you can also build a chart using a `Map` as a datasource. Using the `to` operator, you can construct a `Map` in a very Kotlin-esque way and then pass it as `data` to a `PieChart`. 

```kotlin
 val items = mapOf(
        "Windows" to 77.62,
        "OS X" to 9.52,
        "Other" to 3.06,
        "Linux" to 1.55,
        "Chrome OS" to 0.55
)

piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data(items)
}
```

##XY Based Charts

Most charts often deal with one or more series of data points on an XY axis. These often are represented by bar and line charts. 

###Bar Charts

You can represent one or more series of data points through a `BarChart`. This control makes it easy to compare different data points relative to their distance from the X or Y axis (Figure 8.2).

```kotlin
 barchart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data("MAR", 10245)
        data("APR", 23963)
        data("MAY", 15038)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 28443)
        data("APR", 22845)
        data("MAY", 19045)
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.2**

The `series()` and `data()` functions allow quick construction of data structures backing the charts. On construction, you will need to construct the proper `Axis` type for each X and Y axis. In this example, the months not necessarily numeric but rather Strings. Therefore they are best represented by a `CategoryAxis`.The units, already being numeric, are fit to use a `NumberAxis`. 

>In the `series()` and `data()` blocks, you can customize further properties like colors. You can even call `style()` to quickly apply type-safe CSS to parts of the chart.

##LineChart and AreaChart

A `LineChart` connects data points on an XY axis with lines, quickly visualizing upward and downward trends between them (Figure 8.3)

```kotlin
linechart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data("MAR", 10245)
        data("APR", 23963)
        data("MAY", 15038)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 28443)
        data("APR", 22845)
        data("MAY", 19045)
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.3**

The backing data structure is not really different than a `BarChart`, and you use the `series()` and `data()` functions in the same manner. 

You can also use a variant of `LineChart` called `AreaChart`, which will shade the area under the lines a distinct color (Figure 8.4).

###Multiseries

You can streamline the declaration of more than one series using the `multiseries()` function, and call the `data()` functions in `varargs` fashion. 

```kotlin
linechart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {

    multiseries("Product X", "Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 10245, 28443)
        data("APR", 23963, 22845)
        data("MAY", 15038, 19045)
    }
}
```


###ScatterChart

A `ScatterChart` is the simplest representation of an XY data series. It simply plots the points rather than using bars or lines. It is helpful to identify clustering a large volume of data point in certain areas of the plots, although this example is a bit simpler **Figure 8.5**. 


```kotlin
scatterchart("Machine Capacity by Product/Week", NumberAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data(1,24)
        data(2,22)
        data(3,23)
        data(4,19)
        data(5,18)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data(1,12)
        data(2,15)
        data(3,9)
        data(4,11)
        data(5,7)
    }
}
```

###BubbleChart


`BubbleChart` is another XY chart similar to the `ScatterPlot`, but there is a third variable to control the radius of each point. You can leverage this to show, for example, output by week with bubble radii reflecting number of machines used (Figure 8.6).


```kotlin
 bubblechart("Machine Capacity by Output/Week", NumberAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data(1,24,1)
        data(2,46,2)
        data(3,23,1)
        data(4,27,2)
        data(5,18,1)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data(1,12,1)
        data(2,31,2)
        data(3,9,1)
        data(4,11,1)
        data(5,15,2)
    }
}
```
