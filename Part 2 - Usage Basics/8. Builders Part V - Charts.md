#Builders Part V - Charts

JavaFX comes with a [handy set of charts](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/charts/chart-overview.htm). While there are more comprehensive charting libraries like JFreeChart and Orson Charts, the built-in JavaFX charts satisfy a majority of visualization needs. They also have spiffy animations when they are initialized with data. TornadoFX comes with a few handy builders to streamline the declaration of charts using functional constructs.


##PieChart

The `PieChart` is a common visual aid to illustrate proportions. It is a bit different structurally than XY charts we will learn about later. 

But inside a `piechart()` builder you can call `data()` to pass multiple category-value items (Figure 8.1).

```kotlin
piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data("Windows", 77.62)
    data("OS X", 9.52)
    data("Other", 3.06)
    data("Linux", 1.55)
    data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
}
```
