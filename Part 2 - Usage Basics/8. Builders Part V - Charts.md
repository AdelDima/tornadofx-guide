)#Builders Part V - Charts

JavaFX comes with a [handy set of charts](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/charts/chart-overview.htm) to quickly display data visualizations. While there are more comprehensive charting libraries like JFreeChart and Orson Charts, the built-in JavaFX charts satisfy a majority of visualization needs. They also have spiffy animations when they are initialized with data. TornadoFX comes with a few builders to streamline the declaration of charts using functional constructs.


##PieChart

The `PieChart` is a common visual aid to illustrate proportions of a whole. It is structurally simpler than XY charts which we will learn about later. 

But inside a `piechart()` builder you can call `data()` to pass multiple category-value pairs (Figure 8.1).

```kotlin
piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data("Windows", 77.62)
    data("OS X", 9.52)
    data("Other", 3.06)
    data("Linux", 1.55)
    data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
}
```

Note you can also provide an explicit `ObservableList<PieChart.Data>` prepared in advance. The block following `piechart` can be used to modify any of the attributes of the `PieChart` just like any other control builder we covered. 

```kotlin
val items = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
        PieChart.Data("Windows", 77.62),
        PieChart.Data("OS X", 9.52),
        PieChart.Data("Other", 3.06),
        PieChart.Data("Linux", 1.55),
        PieChart.Data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
)

piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share", items) {
}
```

Or you can pass an entire collection of `items` to the `data()` function. 

```kotlin
piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data(items)
}
```


##XY Based Charts

Most charts often deal with one or more series of data points on an XY axis. These often are represented by bar and line charts. 


###Bar Charts

You can represent one or more series of data points through a `BarChart`. This control makes it easy to compare different data points relative to their distance from the X or Y axis (Figure 8.2).

```kotlin
 barchart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data("MAR", 10245)
        data("APR", 23963)
        data("MAY", 15038)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 28443)
        data("APR", 22845)
        data("MAY", 19045)
    }
}
```

The `series()` and `data()` functions allow quick construction of data structures backing the charts. 


##LineChart and AreaChart

A `LineChart` connects data points on an XY axis with lines, quickly visualizing upward and downward trends between them (Figure 8.3)

```kotlin
linechart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data("MAR", 10245)
        data("APR", 23963)
        data("MAY", 15038)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 28443)
        data("APR", 22845)
        data("MAY", 19045)
    }
}
