#Components

JavaFX uses a theatrical analogy to organize an `Application` with `Stage` and `Scene` components. TornadoFX takes a more streamlined approach using `App`, `View`, `Controller`, and `Fragment` components.  Many of these components are automatically maintained as singletons, and communicate to each other through simple dependency injections. 

You also have the option to utilize FXML which will be discussed in the next chapter. But first, lets extend `App` to create an entry point that launches a TornadoFX application.

##App and View Basics

To create a TornadoFX application, you must have at least one class that extends `App`. This class will be the entry point to the application and specify the initial `View`. This is analogous to a JavaFX `Application` class that has a `start()` method, but there is no `start()` or `main()` method in a `View`. You will need to override and specify a `primaryView` property which we will discuss shortly. 

But first, extend `App` onto your own class.

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    //compile error, must declare primaryView
}
```

You will get a compile error because we need to specify the `primaryView`. This property (of type `View`) is abstract and needs to be overridden. But before we do that, we need to declare a `View`.

A `View` will contain display logic as well as a layout of Nodes, similar to the JavaFX `Scene`. It is automatically managed as a singleton and will be injected wherever it is invoked. When you declare a `View` you must specify a `root` property which can be any `Node` type, and that will hold the View's content. 

In the same Kotlin file or in a new file, extend a class off of `View`. Override the abstract `root` property and assign it `VBox()` or any other `Node` you choose. 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {
    override val root = VBox()
}
```

However, we might want to populate this `VBox` acting as the `root` control. Using the [initializer block](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors), let's add a JavaFX `Button` and a `Label` to the `VBox`. You can use the "plus assign" `+=` operators to add children to any `Pane` type, including `VBox`. 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        root += Button("Press Me")
        root += Label("")
    }
}
```

Commonly you may see the `with()` block used to populate the `root` as well. This may make not look beneficial now, but it helps streamline more complex UI's by providing a block targeting `root`.

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

Now switch back to your `App` class and specify this `View` as your `primaryView` using its [class reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/reflection.html#class-references). You should now no longer have a compile error. 

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}
```

In totality, this should be all your code. Your `App` and `View` could be in the same file, or in separate files. 

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.Button
import javafx.scene.control.Label
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

##Application Startup

For launching and testing the `App`, we will use Intellij IDEA. In IDEA, navigate to *Run*->*Edit Configurations*.

Click the green "+" sign and create a new Application configuration.

Specify the name of your "Main class" which should be your `App` class, as well as the module it resides in. Give the configuration a meaningful name, such as "Launcher". After that click "OK".

After that, you can run your TornadoFX application by selecting *Run*->*Run 'Launcher'* or whatever you named the configuration.

You should now see your user interface open.

Congratulations! You have written your first (albeit simple) TornadoFX application. It may not look like much right now, but as we cover more of TornadoFX's powerful features we will be creating large, impressive user interfaces in no time. But first let's understand a little better what is happening between `App` and `View`.
