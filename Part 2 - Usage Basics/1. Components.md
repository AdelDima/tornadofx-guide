#Components

JavaFX uses a theatrical analogy to organize an `Application` with `Stage` and `Scene` components. TornadoFX takes a different approach using `App`, `View`, `Controller`, and `Fragment` components.  Many of these components are automatically maintained as singletons, and can communicate to each other through simple dependency injections. 

You also have the option to utilize FXML which will be discussed in the next chapter. But first, lets extend `App` to create an entry point that launches a TornadoFX application.

##App and View Basics

To create a TornadoFX application, you must have at least one class that extends `App`. This class will be the entry point to the application and specify the initial `View`. This is analogous to a JavaFX `Application` class that has a `start()` method, but there is no `start()` or `main()` method on a `View`. You will need to override and specify a `primaryView` property which we will discuss shortly. 

But first, extend `App` onto your own class.

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    //compile error, must declare primaryView
}
```

You will get a compile error because we need to specify the `primaryView`. This property is abstract and needs to be overridden. So before we do that, we need to declare a `View` that can be assigned to it. 

A `View` will contain display logic as well as a layout of Nodes, similar to the JavaFX `Scene`. It is automatically managed as a singleton and will be injected wherever it is invoked. When you declare a `View` you must specify a `root` property which can be any `Node` type, and that will hold the View's content. 

In the same Kotlin file or in a new file, extend a class off of `View`. Override the abstract `root` property and assign it `VBox()` or any other `Node` you choose. 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {
    override val root = VBox()
}
```

However, we might want to populate this `VBox` acting as the `root` control. Using the [initializer block](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors), let's add a JavaFX `Button` and a `Label`. You can use the "plus assign" `+=` operators to add children to any `Pane` type, including `VBox`. 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        root += Button("Press Me")
        root += Label("")
    }
}
```

Commonly you may see the `with()` block used to populate the `root`. This may make not look beneficial now, but it helps streamline more complex UI's by providing a block targeting `root`.

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

Now switch back to your `App` class and specify this `View` as your `primaryView` using its [class reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/reflection.html#class-references). You should now no longer have a compile error. 

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}
```

In totality, this should be all your code. Your `App` and `View` could be in the same file, or in separate files. 

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.Button
import javafx.scene.control.Label
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

##Application Startup

For launching and testing the `App`, we will use Intellij IDEA. In IDEA, navigate to *Run*→*Edit Configurations*.

Click the green "+" sign and create a new Application configuration.

Specify the name of your "Main class" which should be your `App` class, as well as the module it resides in. Give the configuration a meaningful name such as "Launcher". After that click "OK".

After that, you can run your TornadoFX application by selecting *Run*→*Run 'Launcher'* or whatever you named the configuration.

You should now see your user interface open.

Congratulations! You have written your first (albeit simple) TornadoFX application. It may not look like much right now, but as we cover more of TornadoFX's powerful features we will be creating large, impressive user interfaces in no time. But first let's understand a little better what is happening between `App` and `View`. 

##Understanding Views

Let's dive a little deeper into how a `View` works and how it can be used. Take a look at the `App` and `View` classes we just built. 

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

A `View` contains a hierarchy of JavaFX Nodes and is injected by name wherever it is needed. In the next section we will learn how to leverage powerful builders to create these `Node` hierarchies quickly. But for now note the `MyApp` has the `MyView` injected to its `primaryView` property. There is only one instance of `MyView` maintained by TornadoFX, effectively making it a singleton.

###Embedding Views
You can also inject one or more Views into another `View`. Below we embed a `TopView` and `BottomView` into a `MasterView`. Note we use the `inject()` delegate property to lazily inject the `TopView` and `BottomView` instances. Then we have to call each "child" View's `root` to assign them to the `BorderPane`.

```kotlin
class MasterView: View() {

    override val root = BorderPane()
    
    val topView: TopView by inject()
    val bottomView: BottomView by inject()

    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
}
```

If you need Views to communicate to each other, you can create a property in each of the "child" Views that can be assigned the "parent" `View`

```kotlin
class MasterView : View() {

    override val root = BorderPane()

    val topView = find(TopView::class)
    val bottomView = find(BottomView::class)

    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }
        
        topView.parent = this
        bottomView.parent = this
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
    lateinit var parent: MasterView
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
    lateinit var parent: MasterView
}
```

If you want to guarantee the `parent` properties are only assigned once, you can use the `singleAssign()` delegate instead of the `lateinit` keyword. This will cause a second assignment to throw an error, and it will also error when it is prematurely accessed before it is assigned.

```kotlin
class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
    var parent: MasterView by singleAssign()
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
    var parent: MasterView by singleAssign()
}
```
We will cover `singleAssign()` in more detail in Section X, but  know for now it guarantees a `var` can only be assigned once. It is also threadsafe and helps mitigate issues with mutability.

###Finding and Injecting
The `inject()` delegate will lazily assign a given component to a property. The first time that component is used is when it will be constructed or retrieved.

Alternatively, instead of using the `inject()` delegate you can use the `find()` function to retrieve a singleton instance of a `View`. 

```kotlin
class MasterView : View() {

    override val root = BorderPane()

    val topView = find(TopView::class)
    val bottomView = find(BottomView::class)
    
    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
}
```
You can use either `find()` or `inject()`, but using `inject()` delegates is typically a little cleaner.
