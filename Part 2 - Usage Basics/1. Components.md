#Components

JavaFX uses a theatrical analogy to organize an `Application` with `Stage` and `Scene` components. TornadoFX takes a different approach using `App`, `View`, `Controller`, and `Fragment` components. While the `Application`, `Stage`, and `Scene` are used by TornadoFX, the `App`, `View`, `Controller`, and `Fragment` introduces new concepts that streamline development. Many of these components are automatically maintained as singletons, and can communicate to each other through simple dependency injections. 

You also have the option to utilize FXML which will be discussed in the next chapter. But first, lets extend `App` to create an entry point that launches a TornadoFX application.

##App and View Basics

To create a TornadoFX application, you must have at least one class that extends `App`. An **App** is the entry point to the application and specifies the initial `View`. It does in fact extend JavaFX `Application`, but you do not necessarily need to specify a `start()` or `main()` method. Typically, you just need to override and specify a `primaryView` property.

But first, extend `App` to create your own implementation.

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    //compile error, must declare primaryView
}
```

You will get a compile error because we need to specify the `primaryView`. This property is abstract and needs to be overridden. So before we do that, we need to declare a `View` that can be assigned to it. 

A **View ** contains display logic as well as a layout of Nodes, similar to the JavaFX `Stage`. It is automatically managed as a singleton and will be injected wherever it is invoked. When you declare a `View` you must specify a `root` property which can be any `Node` type, and that will hold the View's content. 

In the same Kotlin file or in a new file, extend a class off of `View`. Override the abstract `root` property and assign it `VBox()` or any other `Node` you choose. 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {
    override val root = VBox()
}
```

However, we might want to populate this `VBox` acting as the `root` control. Using the [initializer block](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors), let's add a JavaFX `Button` and a `Label`. You can use the "plus assign" `+=` operators to add children to any `Pane` type, including `VBox`. 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        root += Button("Press Me")
        root += Label("")
    }
}
```

Commonly you may see the `with()` block used to populate the `root`. This may make not look beneficial now, but it helps streamline more complex UI's by providing a block to populate root. 

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

>'View' has a property called `primaryStage` that allows you to manipulate properties of the `Stage` backing it, such as window size

Now switch back to your `App` class and specify this `View` as your `primaryView` using its [class reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/reflection.html#class-references). You should now no longer have a compile error. 

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}
```

In totality, this should be all your code. Your `App` and `View` could be in the same file, or in separate files. 

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.Button
import javafx.scene.control.Label
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

Next we will see how to run this application. 

##Application Startup

For launching and testing the `App`, we will use Intellij IDEA. Navigate to *Run*→*Edit Configurations*.

![](http://i.imgur.com/msTSPNm.png)

Click the green "+" sign and create a new Application configuration.

![](http://i.imgur.com/OeejuvB.png)

Specify the name of your "Main class" which should be your `App` class. You will also need to specify the module it resides in. Give the configuration a meaningful name such as "Launcher". After that click "OK".

![](http://i.imgur.com/0QayTdJ.png)

After that, you can run your TornadoFX application by selecting *Run*→*Run 'Launcher'* or whatever you named the configuration.

You should now see your application launch.

Congratulations! You have written your first (albeit simple) TornadoFX application. It may not look like much right now, but as we cover more of TornadoFX's powerful features we will be creating large, impressive user interfaces with little code in no time. But first let's understand a little better what is happening between `App` and `View`. 

##Understanding Views

Let's dive a little deeper into how a `View` works and how it can be used. Take a look at the `App` and `View` classes we just built. 

```kotlin
class MyApp: App() {
    override val primaryView = MyView::class
}

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

A `View` contains a hierarchy of JavaFX Nodes and is injected by name wherever it is called. In the next section we will learn how to leverage powerful builders to create these `Node` hierarchies quickly. But for now note the `MyApp` has the `MyView` injected to its `primaryView` property. There is only one instance of `MyView` maintained by TornadoFX, effectively making it a singleton.

##Using inject() and Embedding Views
You can also inject one or more Views into another `View`. Below we embed a `TopView` and `BottomView` into a `MasterView`. Note we use the `inject()` delegate property to lazily inject the `TopView` and `BottomView` instances. Then we call each "child" View's `root` to assign them to the `BorderPane`.

```kotlin
class MasterView: View() {

    override val root = BorderPane()
    
    val topView: TopView by inject()
    val bottomView: BottomView by inject()

    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
}
```

**RENDERED UI:**

If you need Views to communicate to each other, you can create a property in each of the "child" Views that holds the "parent" `View`

```kotlin
class MasterView : View() {

    override val root = BorderPane()

    val topView = find(TopView::class)
    val bottomView = find(BottomView::class)

    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }
        
        topView.parent = this
        bottomView.parent = this
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
    lateinit var parent: MasterView
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
    lateinit var parent: MasterView
}
```

###singleAssign() Property Delegate

If you want to guarantee the `parent` properties are only assigned once, you can use the `singleAssign()` delegate instead of the `lateinit` keyword. This will cause a second assignment to throw an error, and it will also error when it is prematurely accessed before it is assigned.

```kotlin
class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
    var parent: MasterView by singleAssign()
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
    var parent: MasterView by singleAssign()
}
```
You can look up more about `singleAssign()` in detail in Section X, but know for now it guarantees a `var` can only be assigned once. It is also threadsafe and helps mitigate issues with mutability.

##Injection Using find()
The `inject()` delegate will lazily assign a given component to a property. The first time that component is used is when it will be retrieved. Alternatively, instead of using the `inject()` delegate you can use the `find()` function to retrieve a singleton instance of a `View` or other components.

```kotlin
class MasterView : View() {

    override val root = BorderPane()

    val topView = find(TopView::class)
    val bottomView = find(BottomView::class)
    
    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
}
```
You can use either `find()` or `inject()`, but using `inject()` delegates is the preferred means to perform dependency injection.

##Controllers
In many cases, it is considered a good practice to separate a UI into three distinct parts:

1. **Model** - The business code layer that holds core logic and data
2.  **View** - The visual display with various input and output controls
3.  **Controller** - The "middleman" mediating events between the Model and the View

While you could all logic from the Model and Controller right into the view, it is often cleaner to separate these three pieces distinctly to maximize reusability. This is commonly referred to as the MVC pattern. In TornadoFX, a `Controller` can be injected to support a `View`. 

Here is a simple example. Create a simple `View` with a `TextField` whose value is written to a "database" when a `Button` is clicked.  We can inject a `Controller` that handles interacting with the Model that writes to the database. Since this example is simplified, there will be no database but a printed message will serve as a placeholder. 

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()
    val controller: MyController by inject()

    private val inputField = TextField()
    private val inputButton = Button("Commit")

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Label("Input")
            this += inputField
            this += inputButton
        }

        inputButton.setOnAction {
            controller.writeToDb(inputField.text)
            inputField.clear()
        }
    }
}


class MyController: Controller() {
    fun writeToDb(inputValue: String) {
        println("Writing $inputValue to database!")
    }
}
```

**RENDERED UI:**

![](http://i.imgur.com/CKG7Fb9.png)

When the "Commit" button is clicked, you will see the Controller prints a line to the console. 

```
Writing Alpha to database!
```

You can also use Controllers to provide data to a `View`.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()
    val controller: MyController by inject()

    private val listView = ListView<String>()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Label("My Items")
            this += listView
        }
        listView.items = controller.values
    }
}


class MyController: Controller() {
    val values = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta")
}
```

Whether they are reading or writing data, Controllers can have long-running tasks and should not perform work on the JavaFX thread. See Section X to learn how to offload work to a worker thread. 

##Fragment

Any `View` you create is a singleton, which means you typically use it in only one place. However, if you would like to create a piece of UI that is short-lived or can be used in mulitple places, consider using a `Fragment`. A **Fragment** is a special type of `View` that can have multiple instances that are typically short lived. They are particularliy useful for popups as they have `openModal()` and `closeModal()` functions that can be called. 

```kotlin

class MyView : View() {

    override val root = VBox()

    private val button = Button("Press Me")

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += button
        }
        button.setOnAction { 
            MyFragment().openModal(stageStyle = StageStyle.UTILITY) 
        }
    }
}


class MyFragment: Fragment() {
    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with (root) {
            this += Label("This is a popup")
        }
    }
}
```

You can pass optional arguments to `openModal()` as well to modify a few of its behaviors. 

**Optional Arguments for openModal()**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|stageStyle|StageStyle|Defines one of the possible enum styles for `Stage`|
|modality|Modality|Defines onf the possible enum modality types for `Stage`|
|escapeClostedWindow|Boolean|Sets the `ESC` key to call `closeModal()`|


##SingleViewApp

 If you want to quickly create an application with a single `View`, you can  choose to consolidate your `App` and `View` instances by using a `SingleViewApp`.


```kotlin
class MyApp: SingleViewApp() {
    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Label("Hello World")
        }
    }
}
```

The `SingleViewApp` is effectively an `App` and a `View` rolled into a single abstract class. You can use it to initialize the application and also treat it as the primary `View`. This can be helpful to create [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) code snippits that can be shared with others online. 


##Summary

TornadoFX is filled with simple, streamlined, and powerful injection tools to manage Views and Controllers. It also streamlines dialogs and other small UI pieces using `Fragment`. While the applications we built so far are pretty simple, hopefully you appreciate the simplified concepts TornadoFX introduces to JavaFX. In the next chapter we will cover what is arguably the most powerful feature of TornadoFX: Type-Safe Builders.
