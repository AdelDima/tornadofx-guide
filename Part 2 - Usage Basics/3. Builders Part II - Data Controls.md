#Builders Part II - Data Controls

Any significant application works with data, and providing a means for users to view, manipulate, and modify data is not a trivial task for user interface development. Fortunately, TornadoFX streamlines many JavaFX data controls such as `ListView`, `TableView`, and `TreeView`. These controls can be cumbersome to set up in a purely object-oriented way. But using builders through functional declarations, we can make code all these controls in a much more straightforward way. 

###ListView
A `ListView` is similar to a `ComboBox` but it displays all items (within a `ScrollView` if there are many) and has the option of allowing multiple selections.

```kotlin
listview<String> {
    items.add("Alpha")
    items.add("Beta")
    items.add("Gamma")
    items.add("Delta")
    items.add("Epsilon")
    selectionModel.selectionMode = SelectionMode.MULTIPLE
}
```

**RENDERED UI:**

You can also provide it an `ObservableList` of items up front and omit the type declaration.

```kotlin
val greekLetters = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha","Beta",
        "Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")

listview(greekLetters) {
    selectionModel.selectionMode = SelectionMode.MULTIPLE
}
```

Like most data controls, keep in mind that by default, the `ListView` will call `toString()` to render the text for each item in your domain class.  

###TableView

Probably one of the most impressive builders in TornadoFX is the one for `TableView`. If you have worked with JavaFX, you might have experienced building a `TableView` in an object-oriented way. But TornadoFX provides a functional declaration construct pattern using extension functions that greatly simplifies building a `TableView`.
