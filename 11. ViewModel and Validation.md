# ViewModel and Validation

TornadoFX doesn't force any particular architectural pattern on you as a developer, and it works equally well with both [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) and their derivatives.

To help with implementing these patterns TornadoFX provides a tool called `ViewModel` that helps cleanly separate your UI and business logic, giving you features like *rollback*/*commit* and *dirty state checking*. These patterns are hard or cumbersome to implement manually, so it is advised to leverage the `ViewModel` when it is needed.

## A Typical Use Case

Say you have a given domain type `Person`. We allow its two properties to be nullable so they can be inputted later by the user. 

```kotlin
class Person(name: String? = null, title: String? = null) {
    var name by property(name)
    fun nameProperty() = getProperty(Person::name)

    var title by property(title)
    fun titleProperty() = getProperty(Person::title)
}
```

Consider a Master Detail view where you have a `TableView` displaying a list of people, and a `Form` where the currently selected person's information can be edited. Before we get into the `ViewModel` we will create a minimalist version of this `View` without using the `ViewModel`.

Below is code for our first attempt in building this, and it has a number of problems we will address.

```kotlin
class PersonEditor : View() {
    override val root = BorderPane()
    var nameField : TextField by singleAssign()
    var titleField : TextField by singleAssign()
    var personTable : TableView<Person> by singleAssign()
    // Some fake data for our table
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()

    init {
        title = "Person Editor"

        with(root) {
            // TableView showing a list of people
            center = tableview(persons) {
                personTable = this
                column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
                column("Title", Person::titleProperty)

                // Edit the currently selected person
                selectionModel.selectedItemProperty().onChange {
                    editPerson(it)
                }
            }

            right = form {
                fieldset("Edit person") {
                    field("Name") {
                        textfield() {
                            nameField = this
                        }
                    }
                    field("Title") {
                        textfield() {
                            titleField = this
                        }
                    }
                    button("Save") {
                        setOnAction {
                            save()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private fun editPerson(person: Person?) {
        if (person != null) {
            prevSelection?.apply {
                nameProperty().unbindBidirectional(nameField.textProperty())
                titleProperty().unbindBidirectional(titleField.textProperty())
            }
            nameField.bind(person.nameProperty())
            titleField.bind(person.titleProperty())
            prevSelection = person
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        // Extract the selected person from the tableView
        val person = personTable.selectedItem!!

        // A real application would persist the person here
        println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
    }

}
```

We define a `View` consisting of a `TableView` in the center of a `BorderPane` and a `Form` on the right side. We define some properties for the form fields and the table itself so we can reference them later.

While we build the table we attach a listener to the selected item so we can call the `editPerson` function when the table selection changes. The `editPerson` function binds the properties of the selected person to the text fields in the form.

## Problems with our initial attempt

At first glance it might look OK, but when we dig deeper there are several issues.

### Manual binding

Every time the selection in the table changes, we have to rebind the data for the form fields manually. Apart from the added code and logic, there is another huge problem with this: The data is updated for every change in the text fields, and the changes will even be reflected in the table. While this might look cool, it presents one big problem: What if the user doesn't want to save the changes? We have no way of rolling back. So to prevent this, we would have to skip the binding altogether and manually extract the values from the text fields, then create a new `Person` object on save. In fact, this is a pattern found in many applications. Implementing a "reset" button for this form would mean managing variables with the initial values and again assigning those values manually to the text fields.

### Tight coupling

When it's time to save the edited person, the save function has to extract the the selected item from the table again. For that to happen the save function has to know about the `TableView`. Alternatively it would have to know about the text fields like the `editPerson` function does, and manually extract the values to reconstruct a `Person` object.

## Introducing ViewModel

The `ViewModel` is a mediator between the `TableView` and the `Form`.  It acts as a mediator between the data in the text fields and the data in the actual `Person` object. As you will see, the code is much shorter and easier to reason about. The implementation code of the `PersonModel` will be shown shortly. For now just focus on its usage. 

```kotlin
class PersonEditor : View() {
    override val root = BorderPane()
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()
    val model = PersonModel(Person())

    init {
        title = "Person Editor"

        with(root) {
            center = tableview(persons) {
                column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
                column("Title", Person::titleProperty)

                // Update the person inside the view model on selection change
                model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
                    person = selectedPerson ?: Person()
                }
            }

            right = form {
                fieldset("Edit person") {
                    field("Name") {
                        textfield(model.name)
                    }
                    field("Title") {
                        textfield(model.title)
                    }
                   button("Save") {
                        disableProperty().bind(model.dirtyStateProperty().not())
                        setOnAction {
                            save()
                        }
                    }
                    button("Reset") {
                        setOnAction {
                            model.rollback()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        // Flush changes from the text fields into the model
        model.commit()

        // The edited person is contained in the model
        val person = model.person

        // A real application would persist the person here
        println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
    }

}
```

This looks a lot better, but what's going on here?

We have introduced a subclass of `ViewModel` called `PersonModel`. The model holds a `Person` object and has properties for the `name` and `title` fields. We will discuss the model further after we have looked at the rest of the client code.

Note that we hold no reference to the `TableView` or the the text fields. Apart from a lot less code, the first big change is the way we update the `Person` inside the model:

```kotlin
model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
    person = selectedPerson ?: Person()
}
```

The `rebindOnChange` function takes the `TableView` as an argument and a function that will be called when the selection changes. This works with `ListView`,`TreeView`, `TreeTableView`, and any other `ObservableValue` as well. This function is called on the model and has the selected person as its single argument. We assign the selected person to the `person` property of the model, or a new  `Person` if the selection was empty. That way we ensure that there is always data for the model to present.

When we create the textfields, we bind the model properties directly to it since most `Node` builders accept an `ObservableValue` to bind to.

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name)
}
```

Even when the selection changes, the model properties persist. But the values for the properties are updated. We totally avoid the manual binding from our previous attempt.

Another big change in this version is that the data in the table does not update when we type into the text fields. This is because the model has exposed a copy of the properties from the person object and does not write back into the actual person object before we call `model.commit()`. This is exactly what we do in the `save` function. Once `commit` has been called, the data in the facade is flushed back into our person object and the table will now reflect our changes.

## Rollback

Since the model holds a reference to the actual `Person` object we can can reset the text fields to reflect the actual data in our `Person` object. We could add a reset button like this:

```kotlin
button("Reset") {
    setOnAction {
        model.rollback()
    }
}
```

When the button is pressed, any changes are discarded and the text fields show the actual `Person` object values again.

## Dirty Checking

The model has an observable property called `dirtyStateProperty`. This is a `Boolean`  property you can observe to enable or disable certain features. For example, we could easily disable the save button until there are actual changes. The updated save button would look like this:

```kotlin
button("Save") {
    disableProperty().bind(model.dirtyStateProperty().not())
    setOnAction {
        save()
    }
}
```

We connect the `disableProperty` of the button with an observable `Boolean` property that is true when the model is not dirty (notice the `.not()` call to create a negated binding). Note that there is also a function called `isDirty` that returns a plain `Boolean` value representing the current state of the model.

There is also a plain `val` called `isDirty` which returns a `Boolean` representing the dirty state.

## Dirty Properties

You can check if a specific property is dirty, meaning that it has been changed compared to the backing source object value.

```kotlin
val nameWasChanged = model.isDirty(model.name)
```

There is also a shorter version that accomplishes the same task:

```kotlin
val nameWasChange = model.name.isDirty
```

The shorthand version is an extension `val` on `Property<T>` but it will only work for properties that are bound inside a `ViewModel`. You will find `model.isNotDirty` properties as well.

If you need to dynamically react based on the dirty state of a specific property in the ViewModel you can get a hold of a `BooleanBinding` representing the dirty state of that field like this:

```kotlin
val nameDirtyProperty = model.dirtyStateFor(PersonModel::name)
```

## Extracting the Source Object Value

To find the backing object value for a property you can call `model.backingValue(property)`.

```kotlin
val person = model.backingValue(property)
```

## The PersonModel

You've probably been wondering about how the `PersonModel` is implemented. Here it is: 

```kotlin
class PersonModel(var person: Person) : ViewModel() {
    val name = bind { person.nameProperty() }
    val title = bind { person.titleProperty() }
}
```

It can hold a `Person` object, and it has defined two strange-looking properties called `name` and `title` via the `bind` delegate. Yeah it looks weird, but there is a very good reason for it. The `{ person.nameProperty() }` parameter for the `bind` function is a lambda that returns a property. This returned property is examined by the `ViewModel`, and a new property of the same type is created. It is the put into the `name` property of the `ViewModel`.

When we bind a text field to the `name` property of the model, only the copy is updated when you type into the text field. The `ViewModel` keeps track of which actual property belongs to which facade, and when you call `commit` the values from the facade are flushed into the actual backing property. On the flip side, when you call `rollback` the exact opposite happens: The actual property value is flushed into the facade.

The reason the actual property is wrapped in a function is that this makes it possible to change the `person` variable and then extract the property from that new person. You can read more about this below (rebinding).

## Supporting source objects that doesn't expose JavaFX properties

You probably wondered how to deal with domain objects that doesn't use JavaFX properties. Maybe you have a simple POJO with getters and setters, or normal kotlin `var` type properties. Since `ViewModel` requires JavaFX properties, TornadoFX comes with powerful wrappers that can turn any type of property into an observable JavaFX property. Here are some examples:

```kotlin
// Java POJO getter/setter property
class JavaPersonViewModel(person: JavaPerson) : ViewModel() {
    val name = bind { person.observable(JavaPerson::getName, JavaPerson::setName) }
}

// Kotlin var property
class PersonVarViewModel(person: Person) : ViewModel() {
    val name = bind { person.observable(Person::name) }
}
```

As you can see, it's very easy to convert any property type to an observable property. With the upcoming Kotlin 1.1 the above syntax will be further simplified for non-JavaFX based properties.

## Specific Property subtypes (IntegerProperty, BooleanProperty)

If you bind for example an `IntegerProperty`, the type of the facade property will look like `Property<Int>` but it is infact an `IntegerProperty` under the hood. If you need to access the special functions provided by `IntegerProperty`, you will have to cast the bind result:

```kotlin
val age = bind { person.ageProperty() } as IntegerProperty
```

The reason for this is an unfortunate shortcoming on the type system that prevents the compiler from differentiating between overloaded `bind` functions for these specific types, so the single `bind` function inside ViewModel inspects the property type and returns the best match, but unfortunately the return type signature has to be `Property<T>` for now.

## Rebinding

As you saw in the TableView example above, it is possible to change the domain object that is wrapped by the ViewModel. This test case from the framework tests sheds some more light on that:

```kotlin
@Test fun swap_source_object() {
    val person1 = Person("Person 1")
    val person2 = Person("Person 2")

    val model = PersonModel(person1)
    assertEquals(model.name, "Person 1")

    model.rebind { person = person2 }
    assertEquals(model.name, "Person 2")
}
```

The test creates two `Person` objects and a `ViewModel`. The model is initialised with the first person object. It then checks that `model.name` corresponds to the name in `person1`. Now something weird happens:

```kotlin
model.rebind { person = person2 }
```

The code executed inside the `rebind` block above will be carried out and then all the properties of the model is updated with values from the new source object. This is actually analogous to writing:

```kotlin
model.person = person2
model.rollback()
```

The form you choose is up to you, but the first form makes sure you don't forget to call rebind. After `rebind` is called, the model is not dirty and all values will reflect the ones form the new source object or source objects. It's important to note that you can pass multiple source objects to a view model and update all or some of them as you see fit.

### Rebind listener

Our TableView example called the `rebindOnChange` function and passed in a TableView as the first argument. This made sure that rebind was called whenever the selection of the TableView changed. This is actually just a shortcut to another function with the same name that takes an observable and calls rebind whenever that observable changes. If you call this function you don't need to call rebind manually as long as you have an observable that represent the state change that should cause the model to rebind.

As you saw, TableView has special rebind support for the `selectionModel.selectedItemProperty`. If not for the special support, you would have to write it like this:

```kotlin
model.rebindOnChange(table.selectionModel.selectedItemProperty()) {
    person = it ?: Person() 
}
```

The above example is included to clarify how the `rebindOnChange` function works under the hood. For real use cases involving a TableView you should opt for the shorter version.

## Commit processing

If you want to do some processing on your values after a successful commit, you have two options. The first is to override the `onCommit()` function of the ViewModel. The other is to pass an optional function to the commit call itself. The data will already be updated when both of those calls run. The `onCommit` function on the ViewModel itself is run before the parameter function to commit.

# Validation

Almost every application needs to check that the input supplied by the user conforms to a set of rules or are otherwise acceptable. TornadoFX sports an extensible validation and decoration framework. 
We will first look at validation as a standalone feature before we integrate it with the ViewModel.

## Under the hood

The following explanation is a bit verbose and does not reflect the way you would write validation code in your application. This section will provide you with a solid understanding of how
validation works and how the individual pieces fit together.

### Validator

A `Validator` knows how to inspect user input of a specified type and will return a `ValidationMessage` with a `ValidationSeverity` describing how the input compares to the expected input for a specific control.
If a `Validator` deems that there is nothing to report for an input value, it returns `null`. A text message can optionally accompany the `ValidationMessage`, and would normally be displayed by the `Decorator`
configured in the `ValidationContext`. More on decorators later.

The following severity levels are supported:
   
- `Error` - Input was not accepted
- `Warning` - Input is not ideal, but accepted
- `Success` - Input is accepted
- `Info` - Input is accepted

There are multiple severity levels representing successful input to easier provide the contextually correct feedback in most cases. For example, you might want to give an informational message
for a field no matter the input value, or specifically mark fields with a green checkbox when they are entered. The only severity that will result in an invalid status is te `Error` level.   

### ValidationTrigger

By default validation will happen when the input value changes. The input value is always an `ObservableValue<T>`, and the default trigger simply listens for changes. You can however choose
to validate when the input field looses focus, or when a save button is clicked for instance. The following ValidationTriggers can be configured for each validator:
 
- `OnChange` - Validate when input value changes, optionally after a given delay in milliseconds
- `OnBlur` - Validate when the input field looses focus
- `Never` - Only validate when `ValidationContext.validate()` is called
  
### ValidationContext

Normally you would validate user input from multiple controls or input fields at once. You can gather these validators in a `ValidationContext` so you can check if all validators are valid, or
ask the validation context to perform validation for all fields at any given time. The context also controls what kind of decorator will be used to convey the validation message for each field.

## Decorator

The `decorationProvider` of a ValidationContext is in charge of providing feedback when a `ValidationMessage` is associated with an input. By default this is an instance of `SimpleMessageDecorator`
which will mark the input field with a colored triangle in the topper left corner and display a popup with the message while the input has focus.

![](http://i.imgur.com/3tw57fS.png)
> The default decorator showing a required field validation message

If you don't like the default decorator look you can easily create your own by implementing the `Decorator` interface:

```kotlin
interface Decorator {
    fun decorate(node: Node)
    fun undecorate(node: Node)
}
```

You can assign your decorator to a given `ValidationContext` like this:

```kotlin
context.decorationProvider = MyDecorator()
```

**Tip: You can create a decorator that applies CSS style classes to your inputs instead of overlaying other nodes to provide feedback.**
 
## Ad hoc validation

While you will probably never do this in a real application, it is possible to set up a `ValidationContext` and apply validators to it manually. The following
example is actually taken from the internal tests of the framework. It illustrates the concept, but is not a practical pattern in an application.

```kotlin
// Create a TextField we can attach validation to
val input = TextField()

// Define a validator that accepts input longer than 5 chars
val validator = context.addValidator(input, input.textProperty()) {
    if (it!!.length < 5) error("Too short") else null
}

// Simulate user input
input.text = "abc"

// Validation should fail
assertFalse(validator.validate())

// Extract the validation result
val result = validator.result

// The severity should be error
assertTrue(result is ValidationMessage && result.severity == ValidationSeverity.Error)

// Confirm valid input passes validation
input.text = "longvalue"
assertTrue(validator.validate())
assertNull(validator.result)
```

Take special note of the last parameter to the `addValidator` call. This is the actual validation logic. The function is passed the
current input for the property it validates nad must return null if there are no messages, or an instance of `ValidationMessage` if something
is noteworthy about the input. A message with severity `Error` will cause the validation to fail. As you can see, you don't need to instantiate
a ValidationMessage yourself, simply use one of the functions `error`, `warning`, `success` or `info` instead.

# Validation with ViewModel

Every ViewModel contains a `ValidationContext`, so you don't need to instantiate one yourself. The Validation framework integrates with the type
safe builders as well, and even provides some built in validators, like the `required` validator. Going back to our person editor, we can
make the input fields required with this simple change:

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name).required()
}
```

That's all there is to it. The required validator optionally takes a message that will be presented to the user if the validation fails. The default text
is "This field is required".

Instead of using the built in `required` validator we can express the same thing manually:

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name).validate {
        if (it.isNullOrBlank()) error("The name field is required") else null
    }
}
```

If you want to further customize the textfield, you might want to add another set of curly braces:

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name) {
        // Manipulate the text field here
        validate {
            if (it.isNullOrBlank()) error("The name field is required") else null
        }
    }
}
```
